,27(1) (no pagination),A human papillomavirus (HPV)-1 or HPV-1 genotype is a reliable predictor of residual disease in a subsequent hysterectomy following a loop electrosurgical excision procedure for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3,"Objective: This study was conducted using the human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA chip test (HDC), in order to determine whether the HPV genotype is a predictor of residual disease in a subsequent hysterectomy following a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3. Method(s): Between January 2002 and February 2015, a total of 189 patients who underwent a hysterectomy within 6 months of LEEP caused by CIN 3 were included in this study. We analyzed their epidemiological data, pathological parameters, high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) load as measured by the hybrid capture II assay, and HR-HPV genotype as measured by the HDC. A logistic regression model was used to analyze the relationship between covariates and the probability of residual disease in subsequent hysterectomy specimens. Result(s): Of the 189 patients, 92 (48.7%) had residual disease in the hysterectomy specimen, CIN 2 in seven patients, CIN 3 in 79 patients, IA1 cancer in five patients, and IA2 cancer in one patient. Using multivariate analysis, the results were as follows: cone margin positivity (odds ratio [OR], 2.43; 95% CI, 1.18 to 5.29; p<0.05), HPV viral load >=220 relative light unit (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.38 to 6.43; p<0.01), positive endocervical cytology (OR, 8.97; 95% CI, 3.81 to 21.13; p<0.001), and HPV-16 or HPV-18 positivity (OR, 9.07; 95% CI, 3.86 to 21.30; p<0.001). Conclusion(s): The HPV-16 or HPV-18 genotype is a reliable predictive factor of residual disease in a subsequent hysterectomy following a LEEP for CIN 3.

4791-4805,17,A Regional-Scale Assessment-Based SARS-CoV-2 Variants Control Modeling with Implications for Infection Risk Characterization,"Background: The emergence and progression of highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants have posed increased risks to global public health, triggering the significant impacts on countermeasures since 2020. However, in addition to vaccination, the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing, masking, or hand washing, on different variants of concern (VOC) remains largely unknown. Objective(s): This study provides a mechanistic approach by implementing a control measure model and a risk assessment framework to quantify the impacts of control measure combinations on the transmissions of five VOC (Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, and Omicron), along with a different perspective of risk assessment application. Material(s) and Method(s): We applied uncontrollable ratios as an indicator by adopting basic reproduction number (R<inf>0</inf>) data collected from a regional-scale survey. A risk assessment strategy was established by constructing VOC-specific dose-response profiles to implicate practical uses in risk characterization when exposure data are available. Result(s): We found that social distancing alone was ineffective without vaccination in almost all countries and VOC when the median R<inf>0</inf> was greater than two. Our results indicated that Omicron could not be contained, even when all control measure combinations were applied, due to its low threshold of infectivity (~3x10<sup>-4</sup> plague-forming unit (PFU) mL<sup>-1</sup>). Conclusion(s): To facilitate better decision-making in future interventions, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of how combined control measures impact on different countries and various VOC. Our findings indicate the potential application of threshold estimates of infectivity in the context of risk communication and policymaking for controlling future emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant infections.

Beside clinical procedures and treatments, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a new paradigm for healthcare, several different AI tools that are built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for analyzing data and decision-making processes. This means that AI-driven tools help identify COVID-19 outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread across the globe.

4,62,Amikacin Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Analysis in Pediatric Cancer Patients,"We performed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) and simulation analyses to evaluate a standard amikacin dose of 15 mg/kg once daily in children with cancer and to determine an optimal dosing strategy. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed from clinical data collected in 34 pediatric patients and used in a simulation study to predict the population probability of various dosing regimens to achieve accepted safety (steady-state unbound trough plasma concentration [fC<sub>min</sub>] of <10 mg/liter)- and efficacy (free, unbound plasma concentration-to-MIC ratio [fC<sub>max</sub>/MIC] of >=8)-linked targets. In addition, an adaptive resistance PD (ARPD) model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was built based on literature time-kill curve data and linked to the PK model to perform PK-ARPD simulations and compare results with those of the probability approach. Using the probability approach, an amikacin dose of 60 mg/kg administered once daily is expected to achieve the target fC<sub>max</sub>/MIC in 80% of pediatric patients weighing 8 to 70 kg with a 97.5% probability, and almost all patients were predicted to have fC<sub>min</sub> of <10 mg/liter. However, PK-ARPD simulation predicted that 60 mg/kg/day is unlikely to suppress bacterial resistance with repeated dosing. Furthermore, PK-ARPD simulation suggested that amikacin at 90 mg/kg, given in two divided doses (45 mg/kg twice a day), is expected to hit safety and efficacy targets and is associated with a lower rate of bacterial resistance. The disagreement between the two methods is due to the inability of the probability approach to predict development of drug resistance with repeated dosing. This originates from the use of PK-PD indices based on the MIC that neglects measurement errors, ignores the time course dynamic nature of bacterial growth and killing, and incorrectly assumes the MIC to be constant during treatment.",NA, Journal Article,170199,2018,4,"https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med15&DO=10.1128%2fAAC.01781-17 Ahmed, Mariam A.

132-137,25,Anaemia predictors in patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with ribavirin and direct-acting antiviral agents,"Objectives Anaemia is the most common side effect associated with ribavirin (RBV). This study intended to assess its incidence and determine its predictive factors in patients with hepatitis C virus on RBV plus direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). Methods A retrospective study of patients receiving RBV+DAA was conducted. Serum haemoglobin (Hb) was determined at baseline and monitored 4 weekly. Anaemia was defined as a single occurrence of Hb <10 g/dL. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between the occurrence of anaemia and the following factors: age, gender, FibroScan score, viral load, cirrhotic status (yes/no), RBV dose, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), alanine amino transferase, albumin, treatment duration (12 vs >=12 weeks), baseline Hb, and Hb% drop (weeks 0-2). Results 152 patients were included, of which 15.1% experienced anaemia. The analysis revealed that estimated GFR (eGFR), baseline Hb, 12-week treatment duration and Hb% drop (weeks 0-2) were significantly associated with the likelihood of developing anaemia (p<0.05). Two mathematical models were subsequently developed to predict patients at risk of anaemia: a pretreatment model (positive predictive value 86.6%) which included eGFR, baseline Hb and 12-week treatment duration and an intratreatment model (positive predictive value of 90.48%) which in addition included the Hb% drop (weeks 0-2). Conclusion Anaemia was found to be less significant in this cohort compared with studies on RBV plus pegylated interferon, telaprevir or boceprevir combinations, but higher than those on newer DAAs. Baseline Hb, eGFR, 12-week treatment duration and Hb% drop (weeks 0-2) significantly predicted the risk of anaemia and were used to construct two predictive models.

365-72,10,Association between specific HIV-1 Env traits and virologic control in vivo,"HIV RNA levels are influenced by genetic characteristics of both the host and the virus. Here we applied machine learning techniques to determine if plasma-derived HIV-1 amino acid sequences can be used to predict spontaneous virologic control. We studied the relationship between HIV-1 env genotype and viral load in 20 chronically infected patients undergoing treatment interruptions (SSITT, Swiss-Spanish Intermittent Treatment Trial) and in 104 primary HIV infected (PHI) patients before antiretroviral therapy (cART) and where applicable also after treatment stop. Extensive longitudinal sampling during the interruptions was performed in nine SSITT patients. Sequences obtained from these nine patients during the first virus rebound were used as a training data set and revealed a strong genetic signature (accuracy 98.6% in cross-validation) associated with control of viremia at levels below 5000copies/mL of viral RNA maintained for at least 2 months after the final cART stop. The simple sequence pattern at gp120 positions 268E/358T was confirmed to be predictive of control in the clonal sequences originating from these patients during all subsequent rebounds. Sequences from the remaining 11 SSITT patients with less frequent sampling and from the PHI patients were used for external validation. High sensitivities (71-100%) and negative predictive values (80-100%) but low positive predictive values (12-40%) were achieved in the patient-wise analysis which was based on presence of the genetic pattern in all clones. These results suggest that presence of virus lacking the amino acid pattern 268E/358T is associated with VL >5000 at baseline of PHI and with low probability of spontaneous virologic control after treatment stop. Conversely, however, presence of 268E/358T does not predict control of viremia.

,28(no pagination),"Attitudes towards booster, testing and isolation, and their impact on COVID-19 response in winter 2022/2023 in France, Belgium, and Italy: a cross-sectional survey and modelling study","Background: European countries are focusing on testing, isolation, and boosting strategies to counter the 2022/2023 winter surge due to SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants. However, widespread pandemic fatigue and limited compliance potentially undermine mitigation efforts. Method(s): To establish a baseline for interventions, we ran a multicountry survey to assess respondents' willingness to receive booster vaccination and comply with testing and isolation mandates. Integrating survey and estimated immunity data in a branching process epidemic spreading model, we evaluated the effectiveness and costs of current protocols in France, Belgium, and Italy to manage the winter wave. Finding(s): The vast majority of survey participants (N = 4594) was willing to adhere to testing (>91%) and rapid isolation (>88%) across the three countries. Pronounced differences emerged in the declared senior adherence to booster vaccination (73% in France, 94% in Belgium, 86% in Italy). Epidemic model results estimate that testing and isolation protocols would confer significant benefit in reducing transmission (17-24% reduction, from R = 1.6 to R = 1.3 in France and Belgium, to R = 1.2 in Italy) with declared adherence. Achieving a mitigating level similar to the French protocol, the Belgian protocol would require 35% fewer tests (from 1 test to 0.65 test per infected person) and avoid the long isolation periods of the Italian protocol (average of 6 days vs. 11). A cost barrier to test would significantly decrease adherence in France and Belgium, undermining protocols' effectiveness. Interpretation(s): Simpler mandates for isolation may increase awareness and actual compliance, reducing testing costs, without compromising mitigation. High booster vaccination uptake remains key for the control of the winter wave.

387,17,Baseline gut microbiota diversity and composition and albendazole efficacy in hookworm-infected individuals,"Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections account for a significant global health burden, necessitating mass drug administration with benzimidazole-class anthelmintics, such as albendazole (ALB), for morbidity control. However, ALB efficacy shows substantial variability, presenting challenges for achieving consistent treatment outcomes. We have explored the potential impact of the baseline gut microbiota on ALB efficacy in hookworm-infected individuals through microbiota profiling and machine learning (ML) techniques. Our investigation included 89 stool samples collected from hookworm-infected individuals that were analyzed by microscopy and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Of these, 44 were negative by microscopy for STH infection using the Kato-Katz method and qPCR 21 days after treatment, which entails a cure rate of 49.4%. Microbiota characterization was based on amplicon sequencing of the V3-V4 16S ribosomal RNA gene region. Alpha and beta diversity analyses revealed no significant differences between participants who were cured and those who were not cured, suggesting that baseline microbiota diversity does not influence ALB treatment outcomes. Furthermore, differential abundance analysis at the phylum, family and genus levels yielded no statistically significant associations between bacterial communities and ALB efficacy. Utilizing supervised ML models failed to predict treatment response accurately. Our investigation did not provide conclusive insights into the relationship between gut microbiota and ALB efficacy. However, the results highlight the need for future research to incorporate longitudinal studies that monitor changes in the gut microbiota related to the infection and the cure with ALB, as well as functional metagenomics to better understand the interaction of the microbiome with the drug, and its role, if there is any, in modulating anthelmintic treatment outcomes in STH infections. Interdisciplinary approaches integrating microbiology, pharmacology, genetics and data science will be pivotal in advancing our understanding of STH infections and optimizing treatment strategies globally.",NA, Journal Article,12390,2024,Sep-12,"https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=medl&DO=10.1186%2fs13071-024-06469-1 Fleitas, Pedro E.

17567,13,Bifurcation analysis of a tuberculosis progression model for drug target identification,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The emergence and rapid spread of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains urge us to develop novel treatments. Experimental trials are constrained by laboratory capacity, insufficient funds, low number of laboratory animals and obsolete technology. Systems-level approaches to quantitatively study TB can overcome these limitations. Previously, we proposed a mathematical model describing the key regulatory mechanisms underlying the pathological progression of TB. Here, we systematically explore the effect of parameter variations on disease outcome. We find five bifurcation parameters that steer the clinical outcome of TB: number of bacteria phagocytosed per macrophage, macrophages death, macrophage killing by bacteria, macrophage recruitment, and phagocytosis of bacteria. The corresponding bifurcation diagrams show all-or-nothing dose-response curves with parameter regions mapping onto bacterial clearance, persistent infection, or history-dependent clearance or infection. Importantly, the pathogenic stage strongly affects the sensitivity of the host to these parameter variations. We identify parameter values corresponding to a latent-infection model of TB, where disease progression occurs significantly slower than in progressive TB. Two-dimensional bifurcation analyses uncovered synergistic parameter pairs that could act as efficient compound therapeutic approaches. Through bifurcation analysis, we reveal how modulation of specific regulatory mechanisms could steer the clinical outcome of TB.",NA, Journal Article,35034,2023,10 16,"https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med24&DO=10.1038%2fs41598-023-44569-7 Hernandez-Pando, Rogelio.

6806-6812,60,Comparative Evaluation of the Predictive Performances of Three Different Structural Population Pharmacokinetic Models To Predict Future Voriconazole Concentrations,"Bayesian methods for voriconazole therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) have been reported previously, but there are only sparse reports comparing the accuracy and precision of predictions of published models. Furthermore, the comparative accuracy of linear, mixed linear and nonlinear, or entirely nonlinear models may be of high clinical relevance. In this study, models were coded into individually designed optimum dosing strategies (ID-ODS) with voriconazole concentration data analyzed using inverse Bayesian modeling. The data used were from two independent data sets, patients with proven or suspected invasive fungal infections (n = 57) and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (n = 10). Observed voriconazole concentrations were predicted whereby for each concentration value, the data available to that point were used to predict that value. The mean prediction error (ME) and mean squared prediction error (MSE) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to measure absolute bias and precision, while DELTAME and DELTAMSE and their 95% CI were used to measure relative bias and precision, respectively. A total of 519 voriconazole concentrations were analyzed using three models. MEs (95% CI) were 0.09 (-0.02, 0.22), 0.23 (0.04, 0.42), and 0.35 (0.16 to 0.54) while the MSEs (95% CI) were 2.1 (1.03, 3.17), 4.98 (0.90, 9.06), and 4.97 (-0.54 to 10.48) for the linear, mixed, and nonlinear models, respectively. In conclusion, while simulations with the linear model were found to be slightly more accurate and similarly precise, the small difference in accuracy is likely negligible from the clinical point of view, making all three approaches appropriate for use in a voriconazole TDM program.",NA, Journal Article,214755,2016,11 Observational Study,"https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med13&DO=10.1128%2fAAC.00970-16 Farkas, Andras.

87-94,16(2),Complete Blood Count Parameters to Predict COVID-19 Severity in Pediatric Patients,"Objective: It is thought that hyperinflammation has an important role in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and tests that determine the de-gree of inflammation can be used to predict the severity of the disease. From this point of view, we aimed to determine the hematological parameters that can predict the severity of COVID-19 in pediatric patients. Material(s) and Method(s): Symptomatic and SARS-CoV-2-PCR test positive 105 children were included to study. Seventy-nine patients had mild, 26 had moderate to severe COVID-19 at admission. Data about their demo-graphic characteristics, clinical and laboratory findings were collected from their medical records. Correlations between the hematological parameters and disease severity of patients were investigated by using uni-variate and multivariate regression analyses. Predictive value of different diagnostic markers was studied. Result(s): Mean age was older (177 months vs. 70 months) and mean body mass index (BMI) was higher (18.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs. 25.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) in patients with severe COVID-19 than those with mild. Univariate analysis showed that mean leucocyte (WBC), lymphocyte, eosinophiles, and platelet counts were lower; mean platelet volume (MPV), neutrophil to lympho-cyte ratio (NLR), and derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) were higher in severe COVID-19 group (p< 0.05). Multivariant analysis showed low lymphocyte (OR 0.072) and WBC count (OR 0.085), high dNLR (OR 2.14) and MPV (OR 2.35) indexes were the most valuable parameters to predict disease severity, ROC curve analysis revealed lymphocyte count has superior predictive value (<1.55 /mm<sup>3</sup> has 84.6% sensitivity, 70.9% specificity) than other CBC parameters have. Conclusion(s): Low lymphocyte and leukocyte count, high MPV and dNLR values have significant predictive value in predicting COVID-19 severity. In particular, lymphopenia appears to be a valuable parameter to identify patients at high risk for severe disease and initiate accurate treatment to prevent disease deterioration.

2161-2167,40,Cost-effectiveness analysis of quadrivalent and nonavalent human papillomavirus vaccines in Ethiopia,"Background
In Ethiopia, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women of the reproductive age group. Since 2018, the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (4vHPV) vaccine targeting four HPV types (6/11/16/18) has been introduced in the national immunization program in Ethiopia. Currently, however, a nonavalent HPV (9vHPV) vaccine which provides broader protection against nine HPV types (Ôªø6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58) is available for global use. Our study, therefore, aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 9vHPV vaccine compared to the current HPV vaccination program in Ethiopia.
Method
A static Markov cohort model was used to simulate the progression of HPV infection to cervical cancer for a cohort of 12-years-old girls (N = 100,000) in Ethiopia. The model ran up to the age of 100 years, with a cycle length of 1 year. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to explore the robustness of the model and uncertainties around the parameters included in the model. Cost-effectiveness thresholds of one and three times gross domestic product (GDP) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained were considered.
Results
At a price of US$ 6.9, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per QALY gained for the 9vHPV vaccine was US$ 454 compared to the 4vHPV vaccine, which is less than one times GDP per capita of Ethiopia. The ICER was most sensitive to the change in the discount rate of QALYs. Compared to 4vHPV vaccine, for 9vHPV vaccine to remain very cost-effective and cost-effective, its price per dose should not exceed US$ 8.4 and US$ 15, respectively, at a threshold of one and three times GDP per capita.
Conclusion
Compared to the 4vHPV vaccine, the 9vHPV vaccine is a cost-effective option in Ethiopia, given that its price per dose does not exceed US$15.",Ethiopia, Journal Article,86405,2022,03 25,"https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med21&DO=10.1016%2fj.vaccine.2022.02.080 Postma, Maarten J.

58-69,140,Cost-effectiveness of targeted screening for hepatitis C in The Netherlands,"On account of the serious complications of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and the improved treatment possibilities, the need to improve HCV awareness and case-finding is increasingly recognized. To optimize a future national campaign with this objective, three pilot campaigns were executed in three regions in The Netherlands.

6,8,"Dengue genetic divergence generates within-serotype antigenic variation, but serotypes dominate evolutionary dynamics","Dengue virus (DENV) exists as four genetically distinct serotypes, each of which is historically assumed to be antigenically uniform. Recent analyses suggest that antigenic heterogeneity may exist within each serotype, but its source, extent and impact remain unclear. Here, we construct a sequence-based model to directly map antigenic change to underlying genetic divergence. We identify 49 specific substitutions and four colinear substitution clusters that robustly predict dengue antigenic relationships. We report moderate antigenic diversity within each serotype, resulting in genotype-specific patterns of heterotypic cross-neutralization. We also quantify the impact of antigenic variation on real-world DENV population dynamics, and find that serotype-level antigenic fitness is a dominant driver of dengue clade turnover. These results provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between dengue genetic and antigenic evolution, and quantify the effect of antigenic fitness on dengue evolutionary dynamics.",NA, Journal Article,151172,2019,"08 06 Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.","https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med16&DO=10.7554%2feLife.42496 Bell, Sidney M.

,14(no pagination),Development and validation of a random forest algorithm for source attribution of animal and human Salmonella Typhimurium and monophasic variants of S. Typhimurium isolates in England and Wales utilising whole genome sequencing data,"Source attribution has traditionally involved combining epidemiological data with different pathogen characterisation methods, including 7-gene multi locus sequence typing (MLST) or serotyping, however, these approaches have limited resolution. In contrast, whole genome sequencing data provide an overview of the whole genome that can be used by attribution algorithms. Here, we applied a random forest (RF) algorithm to predict the primary sources of human clinical Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and monophasic variants (monophasic S. Typhimurium) isolates. To this end, we utilised single nucleotide polymorphism diversity in the core genome MLST alleles obtained from 1,061 laboratory-confirmed human and animal S. Typhimurium and monophasic S. Typhimurium isolates as inputs into a RF model. The algorithm was used for supervised learning to classify 399 animal S. Typhimurium and monophasic S. Typhimurium isolates into one of eight distinct primary source classes comprising common livestock and pet animal species: cattle, pigs, sheep, other mammals (pets: mostly dogs and horses), broilers, layers, turkeys, and game birds (pheasants, quail, and pigeons). When applied to the training set animal isolates, model accuracy was 0.929 and kappa 0.905, whereas for the test set animal isolates, for which the primary source class information was withheld from the model, the accuracy was 0.779 and kappa 0.700. Subsequently, the model was applied to assign 662 human clinical cases to the eight primary source classes. In the dataset, 60/399 (15.0%) of the animal and 141/662 (21.3%) of the human isolates were associated with a known outbreak of S. Typhimurium definitive type (DT) 104. All but two of the 141 DT104 outbreak linked human isolates were correctly attributed by the model to the primary source classes identified as the origin of the DT104 outbreak. A model that was run without the clonal DT104 animal isolates produced largely congruent outputs (training set accuracy 0.989 and kappa 0.985; test set accuracy 0.781 and kappa 0.663). Overall, our results show that RF offers considerable promise as a suitable methodology for epidemiological tracking and source attribution for foodborne pathogens.

This study compared the ability of static and dynamic in vitro infection models to distinguish between models with different resistance mechanisms and support accurate and precise parameter estimation. Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) were performed for models with one susceptible bacterial population without (M1) or with a resting stage (M2), a one population model with adaptive resistance (M5), models with pre-existing susceptible and resistant populations without (M3) or with (M4) inter-conversion, and a model with two pre-existing populations with adaptive resistance (M6). For each model, 200 datasets of the total bacterial population were simulated over 24h using static antibiotic concentrations (256-fold concentration range) or over 48h under dynamic conditions (dosing every 12h; elimination half-life: 1h). Twelve-hundred random datasets (each containing 20 curves for static or four curves for dynamic conditions) were generated by bootstrapping. Each dataset was estimated by all six models via population PD modeling to compare bias and precision. For M1 and M3, most parameter estimates were unbiased (<10%) and had good imprecision (<30%). However, parameters for adaptive resistance and inter-conversion for M2, M4, M5 and M6 had poor bias and large imprecision under static and dynamic conditions. For datasets that only contained viable counts of the total population, common statistical criteria and diagnostic plots did not support sound identification of the true resistance mechanism. Therefore, it seems advisable to quantify resistant bacteria and characterize their MICs and resistance mechanisms to support extended simulations and translate from in vitro experiments to animal infection models and ultimately patients.",NA, Journal Article,222534,2016,"Mar Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med13&DO=10.1371%2fjournal.pcbi.1004782 Gregoire, Nicolas.

855-60,24,Effect of spatial distribution of T-Cells and HIV load on HIV progression,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>
               <jats:p>Motivation: We present a spatial-temporal (ST) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) simulation model to investigate the spatial distribution of viral load and T-cells during HIV progression. The proposed model uses the Finite Element (FE) method to divide a considered infected region into interconnected subregions each containing viral population and T-cells. HIV T-cells and viral load are traced and counted within and between subregions to estimate their effect upon neighboring regions. The objective is to estimate overall ST changes of HIV progression and to study the ST therapeutic effect upon HIV dynamics in spatial and temporal domains. We introduce sub-regional (spatial) parameters of T-cells and viral load production and elimination to estimate the spatial propagation and interaction of HIV dynamics under the influence of a 3TC D4T Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (RTI) drug regimen.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>Results: In terms of percentage change standard deviation, we show that the average rate per 10 weeks (throughout a 10-year clinical trial) of the ST CD4+ change is 5.35% 1.3 different than that of the CD4+ rate of change in laboratory datasets, and the average rate of change of the ST CD8+ is 4.98% 1.93 different than that of the CD8+ rate of change. The half-life of the ST CD4+ count is 1.68% 3.381 different than the actual half-life of the CD4+ count obtained from laboratory datasets. The distribution of the viral load and T-cells in a considered region tends to cluster during the HIV progression once a threshold of 86‚Äì89% viral accumulation is reached.</jats:p>

100748,46,Ensemble<sup>2</sup>: Scenarios ensembling for communication and performance analysis,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, scenario modeling played a crucial role in shaping the decision-making process of public health policies. Unlike forecasts, scenario projections rely on specific assumptions about the future that consider different plausible states-of-the-world that may or may not be realized and that depend on policy interventions, unpredictable changes in the epidemic outlook, etc. As a consequence, long-term scenario projections require different evaluation criteria than the ones used for traditional short-term epidemic forecasts. Here, we propose a novel ensemble procedure for assessing pandemic scenario projections using the results of the Scenario Modeling Hub (SMH) for COVID-19 in the United States (US). By defining a ""scenario ensemble"" for each model and the ensemble of models, termed ""Ensemble<sup>2</sup>"", we provide a synthesis of potential epidemic outcomes, which we use to assess projections' performance, bypassing the identification of the most plausible scenario. We find that overall the Ensemble<sup>2</sup> models are well-calibrated and provide better performance than the scenario ensemble of individual models. The ensemble procedure accounts for the full range of plausible outcomes and highlights the importance of scenario design and effective communication. The scenario ensembling approach can be extended to any scenario design strategy, with potential refinements including weighting scenarios and allowing the ensembling process to evolve over time.",United States, Journal Article,26449,2024,Mar,"https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med25&DO=10.1016%2fj.epidem.2024.100748 St-Onge, Guillaume.

4,62,Evaluating the Relationship between Vancomycin Trough Concentration and 24-Hour Area under the Concentration-Time Curve in Neonates,"Bacterial sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates, especially those involving methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend the vancomycin 24-h area under the concentration-time curve to MIC ratio (AUC<sub>24</sub>/MIC) of >400 as the best predictor of successful treatment against MRSA infections when the MIC is <=1 mg/liter. The relationship between steady-state vancomycin trough concentrations and AUC<sub>24</sub> values (mg.h/liter) has not been studied in an Asian neonatal population. We conducted a retrospective chart review in Singapore hospitals and collected patient characteristics and therapeutic drug monitoring data from neonates on vancomycin therapy over a 5-year period. A one-compartment population pharmacokinetic model was built from the collected data, internally validated, and then used to assess the relationship between steady-state trough concentrations and AUC<sub>24</sub> A Monte Carlo simulation sensitivity analysis was also conducted. A total of 76 neonates with 429 vancomycin concentrations were included for analysis. Median (interquartile range) was 30 weeks (28 to 36 weeks) for postmenstrual age (PMA) and 1,043 g (811 to 1,919 g) for weight at the initiation of treatment. Vancomycin clearance was predicted by weight, PMA, and serum creatinine. For MRSA isolates with a vancomycin MIC of <=1, our major finding was that the minimum steady-state trough concentration range predictive of achieving an AUC<sub>24</sub>/MIC of >400 was 8 to 8.9 mg/liter.

Material(s) and Method(s): We developed the HPV16-ALIFE prototype using artificial life techniques to be used as a virtual laboratory. To evaluate the model, we analysed the responses of the simulated immune system under 2 circumstances: when a persistent infection is present that originates from HPV16 and causes lesions, and when the nanodevice releases a dose as part of a therapeutic vaccination strategy. Performing virtual trials means we can produce results for subsequent analysis and comparison with real-world clinical data. Result(s) and Conclusion(s): The simulations enabled us to observe the proliferation of different cell populations considered in the model, levels of viral protein expression and cytokine secretion, transition stages of the developing infectious process-, low- and high-grade intraepithelial lesions, pre-cancer, and cancer status. The virtual patients who did not receive vaccines developed cancer status with peak rates of 18.86%. The patients who received a vaccination strategy reported a significant decrease in their cancer status, with peak rates varying between 0.48 and 3.12%, according to the specifications associated with each vaccine evaluated. The simulated immune system proved responsive to the activity of the virus and the vaccine.

38-45,Part B. 11,Evaluation of Dynamic Variation in Red Cell Distribution Width as a Septic Marker in Comparison with Procalcitonin Levels and Clinical Scores in Patients with Sepsis or Septic Shock: A Prospective Observational Study,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a dysregulated host response to infection resulting in potentially life-threatening organ dysfunction. Elevation in red cell distribution width (RDW), a simple routinely done investigation, could be a prognostic marker in these patients. AIM: We performed this prospective observational study to assess role of dynamic variation of RDW in predicting 30-day mortality in patients with sepsis or septic shock presenting and getting admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) in Fayoum, Egypt. METHOD(S): Between January 2019 and January 2021, 150 patients with sepsis or septic shock at admission were prospectively evaluated for association between RDW value on admission, on day 4, on day 7, and 30-day mortality. To find out factors associated independently with 30-day mortality, we applied multivariate logistic regression analysis and used the analysis to develop nanogram for prediction of mortality on admission. RESULT(S): Among 150 patients, 89 (59.3%) were male. Mean age of the patients was 59.6 +/- 12.28 years. Regarding RDW on admission (RDW-0), the mean was 14.1 +/- 1.9 while on day 4 (RDW-4), the mean was 14.5 +/- 1.97, and on day 7 (RDW-7), the mean was 14.4 +/- 2.03. Seventy-four (49.3%) patients died during the period of 30 days follow-up. Multiple logistic regression models for the parameters associated with the mortality outcome at admission were done, for age, higher age was associated with higher probability of mortality, OR = 1.07 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.13). Male sex was associated with lower probability of mortality as compared to females, OR = 0.02 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.80). Higher acute physiologic assessment and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II score, RDW value, and procalcitonin level, all were associated with higher mortality probability. For APACHE II score, higher level was associated with higher odds of mortality, OR = 1.16. For RDW value on admission, higher value was associated with higher odds of mortality, OR = 1.66. For procalcitonin level at admission, higher level was associated with higher odds of mortality, OR = 1.54. Odds for mortality for those who showed any increase in RDW in day 4 as compared to day 0 are higher as compared to those who showed a decrease or no change in RDW, OR = 2.8, p-value = 0.007. CONCLUSION(S): We found that an increase in RDW value on admission and on day 4 is significantly associated with mortality. And that, an increase in RDW value from day 0 to day 4 is also significantly associated with mortality Therefore, a combination of baseline RDW value and an increase in serial RDW values can be a promising independent prognostic marker in patients with sepsis or septic shock.

Jul-18,170,Evolution of human immunodeficiency virus under selection and weak recombination,"To predict emergence of drug resistance in patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy, we study accumulation of preexisting beneficial alleles in a haploid population of N genomes. The factors included in the model are selection with the coefficient s and recombination with the small rate per genome r (r << s sqrt of k, where k is the average number of less-fit loci per genome). Mutation events are neglected. To describe evolution at a large number of linked loci, we generalize the analytic method we developed recently for an asexual population. We show that the distribution of genomes over the deleterious allele number moves in time as a ""solitary wave"" that is quasi-deterministic in the middle (on the average) but has stochastic edges. We arrive at a single-locus expression for the average accumulation rate, in which the effects of linkage, recombination, and random drift are all accounted for by the effective selection coefficient s lnNr/lnNs(2)k/r. At large N, the effective selection coefficient approaches the single-locus value s. Below the critical size N(c) approximately 1/r, a population eventually becomes a clone, recombination cannot produce new sequences, and virus evolution stops. Taking into account finite mutation rate predicts a small, finite rate of evolution at N < N(c). We verify the accuracy of the results analytically and by Monte Carlo simulation. On the basis of our findings, we predict that partial depletion of the HIV population by combined anti-retroviral therapy can suppress emergence of drug-resistant strains.",NA, Journal Article,387776,2005,"May Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med6&DO=10.1534%2fgenetics.104.029926,Genetics,480587,Evolution of human immunodeficiency virus under selection and weak recombination,"Rouzine, I M Coffin, J M R01 CA089441 K25 AI001811 R37 CA089441 CA89441 K25AI01811 R35CA44385",1,0016-6731,"15744057 Data Interpretation, Statistical *Evolution, Molecular *HIV/ge [Genetics] Humans Models, Genetic Monte Carlo Method Mutation Population *Recombination, Genetic *Selection, Genetic",Include,"The abstract presents a mathematical model analyzing the evolution of HIV under selection and recombination pressures.

e1002452,8,Evolutionary game theory and social learning can determine how vaccine scares unfold,"Immunization programs have often been impeded by vaccine scares, as evidenced by the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) autism vaccine scare in Britain. A ""free rider"" effect may be partly responsible: vaccine-generated herd immunity can reduce disease incidence to such low levels that real or imagined vaccine risks appear large in comparison, causing individuals to cease vaccinating. This implies a feedback loop between disease prevalence and strategic individual vaccinating behavior. Here, we analyze a model based on evolutionary game theory that captures this feedback in the context of vaccine scares, and that also includes social learning. Vaccine risk perception evolves over time according to an exogenously imposed curve. We test the model against vaccine coverage data and disease incidence data from two vaccine scares in England & Wales: the whole cell pertussis vaccine scare and the MMR vaccine scare. The model fits vaccine coverage data from both vaccine scares relatively well. Moreover, the model can explain the vaccine coverage data more parsimoniously than most competing models without social learning and/or feedback (hence, adding social learning and feedback to a vaccine scare model improves model fit with little or no parsimony penalty). Under some circumstances, the model can predict future vaccine coverage and disease incidence--up to 10 years in advance in the case of pertussis--including specific qualitative features of the dynamics, such as future incidence peaks and undulations in vaccine coverage due to the population's response to changing disease incidence. Vaccine scares could become more common as eradication goals are approached for more vaccine-preventable diseases. Such models could help us predict how vaccine scares might unfold and assist mitigation efforts.",England & Wales, Journal Article,295892,2012,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med9&DO=10.1371%2fjournal.pcbi.1002452,PLoS Computational Biology,456135,Evolutionary game theory and social learning can determine how vaccine scares unfold,"Bauch, Chris T Bhattacharyya, Samit",4,1553-7358,22496631 *Disease Outbreaks/pc [Prevention & Control] Disease Outbreaks/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data] *Game Theory *Health Behavior Humans Imitative Behavior Learning *Mass Vaccination/sn [Statistics & Numerical Data] *Social Behavior *Virus Diseases/ep [Epidemiology] *Virus Diseases/pc [Prevention & Control],Include,"The abstract presents a mathematical model based on evolutionary game theory, which fits within the inclusion criteria.

2171,24,"Forecasting and analyzing influenza activity in Hebei Province, China, using a CNN-LSTM hybrid model","Background
Influenza, an acute infectious respiratory disease, presents a significant global health challenge. Accurate prediction of influenza activity is crucial for reducing its impact. Therefore, this study seeks to develop a hybrid Convolution Neural Network‚ÄîLong Short Term Memory neural network (CNN-LSTM) model to forecast the percentage of influenza-like-illness (ILI) rate in Hebei Province, China. The aim is to provide more precise guidance for influenza prevention and control measures.
Methods
Using ILI% data from 28 national sentinel hospitals in the Hebei Province, spanning from 2010 to 2022, we employed the Python deep learning framework PyTorch to develop the CNN-LSTM model. Additionally, we utilized R and Python to develop four other models commonly used for predicting infectious diseases. After constructing the models, we employed these models to make retrospective predictions, and compared each model‚Äôs prediction performance using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and other evaluation metrics.
Results
Based on historical ILI% data from 28 national sentinel hospitals in Hebei Province, the Seasonal Auto-Regressive Indagate Moving Average (SARIMA), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term Memory neural network (LSTM) models were constructed. On the testing set, all models effectively predicted the ILI% trends. Subsequently, these models were used to forecast over different time spans. Across various forecasting periods, the CNN-LSTM model demonstrated the best predictive performance, followed by the XGBoost model, LSTM model, CNN model, and SARIMA model, which exhibited the least favorable performance.
Conclusion
The hybrid CNN-LSTM model had better prediction performances than the SARIMA model, CNN model, LSTM model, and XGBoost model. This hybrid model could provide more accurate influenza activity projections in the Hebei Province.","Hebei Province, China", Journal Article,14432,2024,Aug-12,"https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=medl&DO=10.1186%2fs12889-024-19590-8 Li, Yan.

Material(s) and Method(s): This prospective study comprised 483 adults aged 60 years and older, all vaccinated with 2 doses of inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. All participants had their anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G antibody titers checked and were simultaneously evaluated by comprehensive geriatric assessment, including frailty. We defined the overall survival time as the period from the date of blood collection for antibody responses through the event date [i.e., PCR confirmed (COVID-19) diagnosis] (if any), the time of the last visit or at the termination of data collection (November 25, 2021), whichever occurred first. Individuals who were vaccinated with the 3<sup>rd</sup> dose of any type were censored at the time of vaccination and removed from further follow-up. Result(s): The incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 was significantly higher in the frail group, with a cumulative incidence of 7.1% and 2.2% in the frail and non-frail groups, respectively (p=0.02). In Cox regression analysis, the clinical frailty scale (CFS) score was found to be a significant predictor for breakthrough COVID-19 infection [hazard ratio: 3.2 (95% confidence interval: 1.0-9.9), p=0.04].

41,8,Genome-scale metabolic modeling reveals increased reliance on valine catabolism in clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae,"Infections due to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae have recently emerged as one of the most urgent threats to hospitalized patients within the United States and Europe. By far the most common etiological agent of these infections is Klebsiella pneumoniae, frequently manifesting in hospital-acquired pneumonia with a mortality rate of ~50% even with antimicrobial intervention. We performed transcriptomic analysis of data collected previously from in vitro characterization of both laboratory and clinical isolates which revealed shifts in expression of multiple master metabolic regulators across isolate types. Metabolism has been previously shown to be an effective target for antibacterial therapy, and genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) have provided a powerful means to accelerate identification of potential targets in silico. Combining these techniques with the transcriptome meta-analysis, we generated context-specific models of metabolism utilizing a well-curated GENRE of K. pneumoniae (iYL1228) to identify novel therapeutic targets.

Here, we use a combined modelling and comparative data analysis framework to address this issue for human infections with the filarial parasite, Wuchereria bancrofti. By analogy with previous work, the analysis involves the comparison of observed field patterns of infection with epidemiological patterns predicted by a mathematical model of parasite immunity. Unlike most other human helminths, which are transmitted by ingestion or dermal penetration, exposure to infection with lymphatic filariasis can be measured explicitly in terms of vector mosquito biting rates, thereby also allowing, probably for the first time, examination of the suggested role of exposure in generating herd immunity to macroparasites. Observed field patterns in this study were derived from 19 different published studies, which gave parallel estimates of community exposure rates and the corresponding age--prevalence patterns of infection, while predictions of the epidemiological impact of herd immunity were obtained using a catalytic model framework. The results provide the first conclusive evidence to date that variations in the observed age--prevalence patterns of infection in filariasis can be effectively explained by the occurrence of an exposure-driven acquisition of herd immunity.

Application of the capture-recapture method to three surveillance systems,"Despite control measures, foodborne outbreaks of non-typhi Salmonella infection continue to occur in developed countries. The authors aimed to assess the number of foodborne Salmonella outbreaks that occurred in France in 1995 using a capture-recapture approach. Data from three sources--the National Public Health Network (NPHN), the Ministry of Agriculture (MA), which receives mandatory notification, and the National Salmonella and Shigella Reference Center (NRC)-were collected. Matching algorithms permitted identification of matched outbreaks. The total number of outbreaks was estimated by log-linear modeling taking into account source dependencies and the variable catchability. The final estimate was adjusted for the positive predictive value (66%) of the NRC case definition. The dependence between the NPHN and the MA was also evaluated by means of a qualitative survey. A total of 716 foodborne Salmonella outbreaks were reported to the three sources, and 108 matches were identified. The best-fitting model, taking into account a positive dependence between the NPHN and MA sources, gave an estimate of 757 outbreaks.

,10(5) (no pagination),How to Determine the Accuracy of an Alternative Diagnostic Test when It Is Actually Better than the Reference Tests: A Re-Evaluation of Diagnostic Tests for Scrub Typhus Using Bayesian LCMs,"Background

The indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) is considered a reference test for scrub typhus. Recently, the Scrub Typhus Infection Criteria (STIC; a combination of culture, PCR assays and IFA IgM) were proposed as a reference standard for evaluating alternative diagnostic tests. Here, we use Bayesian latent class models (LCMs) to estimate the true accuracy of each diagnostic test, and of STIC, for diagnosing scrub typhus.

Methods/Principal Findings

Data from 161 patients with undifferentiated fever were re-evaluated using Bayesian LCMs. Every patient was evaluated for the presence of an eschar, and tested with blood culture for Orientia tsutsugamushi, three different PCR assays, IFA IgM, and the Panbio IgM immunochromatographic test (ICT). True sensitivity and specificity of culture (24.4% and 100%), 56kDa PCR assay (56.8% and 98.4%), 47kDa PCR assay (63.2% and 96.1%), groEL PCR assay (71.4% and 93.0%), IFA IgM (70.0% and 83.8%), PanBio IgM ICT (72.8% and 96.8%), presence of eschar (42.7% and 98.9%) and STIC (90.5% and 82.5%) estimated by Bayesian LCM were considerably different from those obtained when using STIC as a reference standard. The IgM ICT had comparable sensitivity and significantly higher specificity compared to IFA (p=0.34 and p<0.001, respectively).

Conclusions

The low specificity of STIC was caused by the low specificity of IFA IgM. Neither STIC nor IFA IgM can be used as reference standards against which to evaluate alternative diagnostic tests.

254-264,66,Human health risk implications of multiple sources of faecal indicator bacteria in a recreational waterbody,"We simulate the influence of multiple sources of enterococci (ENT) as faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in recreational water bodies on potential human health risk by considering waters impacted by human and animal sources, human and non-pathogenic sources, and animal and non-pathogenic sources. We illustrate that risks vary with the proportion of culturable ENT in water bodies derived from these sources and estimate corresponding ENT densities that yield the same level of health protection that the recreational water quality criteria in the United States seeks (benchmark risk). The benchmark risk is based on epidemiological studies conducted in water bodies predominantly impacted by human faecal sources. The key result is that the risks from mixed sources are driven predominantly by the proportion of the contamination source with the greatest ability to cause human infection (potency), not necessarily the greatest source(s) of FIB. Predicted risks from exposures to mixtures comprised of approximately 30% ENT from human sources were up to 50% lower than the risks expected from purely human sources when contamination is recent and ENT levels are at the current water quality criteria levels (35 CFU 100 mL(-1)). For human/non-pathogenic, human/gull, human/pig, and human/chicken faecal mixtures with relatively low human contribution, the predicted culturable enterococci densities that correspond to the benchmark risk are substantially greater than the current water quality criteria values.

,25(no pagination),Immunoinformatics aided-design of novel multi-epitope based peptide vaccine against Hendra henipavirus through proteome exploration,"Hendra henipavirus (HeV) is an emerging zoonotic bat-borne paramyxovirus that is capable of causing severe public health complications in humans. It promotes both respiratory and neurological disorders in humans as well as in horses. Currently, there are no therapeutics or vaccines available against the deadly HeV. We aimed to design a potent and novel prophylactic chimeric vaccine against HeV through an immunoinformatics approach. A proteome-wide screening was performed to identify the antigenic proteins followed by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL), linear B-lymphocyte (LBL), and helper T-lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes identification, conservancy analysis, population coverage, molecular docking and in silico simulation of both cellular and humoral immune response. A total of 17 T and B-cell epitopes (7 CTL, 5 HTL, and 5 LBL) were identified for vaccine design from the highest antigenic proteins, namely glycoprotein, fusion protein, and nucleoprotein. The proposed vaccine was found to be highly immunogenic, antigenic, non-toxic, non-allergenic, and stable, and could be efficient against HeV. Moreover, disulfide engineering and codon adaptation were employed to escalate stability and efficient expression in E. coli. Molecular docking and dynamics simulation analysis revealed the stability and strong affinity of the proposed vaccine towards the TL4 receptor. The immune simulation data confirmed elevated response of both B and T-cells against the vaccine subunit. The designed vaccine according to our in silico data is potent enough to elucidate substantial immune response and therefore can be considered as a potential immunogenic agent to control HeV infection. However, further experimental validation and clinical trials are required to confirm its efficacy and safety.

1105-1112,49,Impact of visitation and cohorting policies to shield residents from covid-19 spread in care homes: an agent-based model,"Background

This study examines the impact of visitation and cohorting policies as well as the care home population size upon the spread of COVID-19 and the risk of outbreak occurrence in this setting.
Methods

Agent-based modelling
Results

The likelihood of the presence of an outbreak in a care home is associated with the care home population size. Cohorting of residents and staff into smaller, self-contained units reduces the spread of COVID-19. Restricting the number of visitors to the care home to shield its residents does not significantly impact the cumulative number of infected residents and risk of outbreak occurrence in most scenarios. Only when the community prevalence where staff live is considerably lower than the prevalence where visitors live (the former prevalence is less than or equal to 30% of the latter), relaxing visitation increases predicted infections much more significantly than it does in other scenarios. Maintaining a low infection probability per resident-visitor contact helps reduce the effect of allowing more visitors into care homes.
Conclusions

Our model predictions suggest that cohorting is effective in controlling the spread of COVID-19 in care homes. However, according to predictions shielding residents in care homes is not as effective as predicted in a number of studies that have modelled shielding of vulnerable population in the wider communities.",NA, Journal Article,95768,2021,9,"https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med20&DO=10.1016%2fj.ajic.2021.07.001 Howick, Susan.

In this report we analyze temporal trends in malaria in Britain between 1840 and 1910, to assess the potential for reemergence of the disease. Our results demonstrate that at least 20% of the drop-off in malaria was due to increasing cattle population and decreasing acreage of marsh wetlands. Although both rainfall and average temperature were associated with year-to-year variability in death rates, there was no evidence for any association with the long-term malaria trend. Model simulations for future scenarios in Britain suggest that the change in temperature projected to occur by 2050 is likely to cause a proportional increase in local malaria transmission of 8-14%.

9,71,Mathematical Model of COVID-19 Pandemic with Double Dose Vaccination,"This paper is concerned with the formulation and analysis of an epidemic model of COVID-19 governed by an eight-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations, by taking into account the first dose and the second dose of vaccinated individuals in the population. The developed model is analyzed and the threshold quantity known as the control reproduction number [Formula: see text] is obtained. We investigate the equilibrium stability of the system, and the COVID-free equilibrium is said to be locally asymptotically stable when the control reproduction number is less than unity, and unstable otherwise. Using the least-squares method, the model is calibrated based on the cumulative number of COVID-19 reported cases and available information about the mass vaccine administration in Malaysia between the 24th of February 2021 and February 2022. Following the model fitting and estimation of the parameter values, a global sensitivity analysis was performed by using the Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) to determine the most influential parameters on the threshold quantities. The result shows that the effective transmission rate [Formula: see text], the rate of first vaccine dose [Formula: see text], the second dose vaccination rate [Formula: see text] and the recovery rate due to the second dose of vaccination [Formula: see text] are the most influential of all the model parameters. We further investigate the impact of these parameters by performing a numerical simulation on the developed COVID-19 model.

11628-11656,19,Modeling the effect of time delay in the increment of number of hospital beds to control an infectious disease,"One of the key factors to control the spread of any infectious disease is the health care facilities, especially the number of hospital beds. To assess the impact of number of hospital beds and control of an emerged infectious disease, we have formulated a mathematical model by considering population (susceptible, infected, hospitalized) and newly created hospital beds as dynamic variables. In formulating the model, we have assumed that the number of hospital beds increases proportionally to the number of infected individuals. It is shown that on a slight change in parameter values, the model enters to different kinds of bifurcations, e.g., saddle-node, transcritical (backward and forward), and Hopf bifurcation. Also, the explicit conditions for these bifurcations are obtained. We have also shown the occurrence of Bogdanov-Takens (BT) bifurcation using the Normal form. To set up a new hospital bed takes time, and so we have also analyzed our proposed model by incorporating time delay in the increment of newly created hospital beds. It is observed that the incorporation of time delay destabilizes the system, and multiple stability switches arise through Hopf-bifurcation. To validate the results of the analytical analysis, we have carried out some numerical simulations.",NA, Journal Article,78699,2022,08 15,"https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med22&DO=10.3934%2fmbe.2022541 Maurya, Jyoti.

Jan-13,108,Modeling the emergence of HIV-1 drug resistance resulting from antiretroviral therapy: insights from theoretical and numerical studies,"The use of antiretroviral therapy has proven to be remarkably effective in controlling the progression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and prolonging patient's survival. Therapy however may fail and therefore these benefits can be compromised by the emergence of HIV strains that are resistant to the therapy. In view of these facts, the question of finding the reason for which drug-resistant strains emerge during therapy has become a worldwide problem of great interest. This paper presents a deterministic HIV-1 model to examine the mechanisms underlying the emergence of drug-resistance during therapy. The aim of this study is to determine whether, and how fast, antiretroviral therapy may determine the emergence of drug resistance by calculating the basic reproductive numbers. The existence, feasibility and local stability of the equilibriums are also analyzed. By performing numerical simulations we show that Hopf bifurcation may occur.

Alternative scenarios either allowing repeated infections with the HPV-16 (i.e. SIS scenario) or assuming that clearance of infection occurs through the development of a long lasting, specific immune response which protects against re-infection (i.e. SIR scenario) were investigated. The difference in reduction in lifetime cervical cancer achieved through vaccination of 12-year-old girls, between SIS and SIR scenarios, was up to 25% of expected cases in an unscreened population. This difference increased to 30% when vaccination of 12-year-old boys was also included as an intervention.

However, it is not known whether such changes can be detected and verified using routinely collected data. We examined the correlation between the weekly number and average age of cases using data on pre-vaccination measles and rotavirus. We show that age-incidence patterns can be observed and predicted for these childhood infections. Incorporating additional information about important features of the transmission dynamics improves the correspondence between model predictions and empirical data. We then explored whether knowledge of the age-incidence pattern can shed light on the epidemiological features of diseases of unknown aetiology, such as Kawasaki disease (KD). Our results indicate KD is unlikely to be triggered by a single acute immunizing infection, but is consistent with an infection of longer duration, a non-immunizing infection or co-infection with an acute agent and one with longer duration. Age-incidence patterns can lend insight into important epidemiological features of infections, providing information on transmission-relevant population mixing for known infections and clues about the aetiology of complex paediatric diseases.",NA, Journal Article,297313,2012,"Jul 22 Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med9&DO=10.1098%2frspb.2011.2464,Proceedings of the Royal Society of London - Series B: Biological Sciences,341742,Modelling seasonal variations in the age and incidence of Kawasaki disease to explore possible infectious aetiologies,"Pitzer, Virginia E Burgner, David Viboud, Cecile Simonsen, Lone Andreasen, Viggo Steiner, Claudia A Lipsitch, Marc 5U54GM088558-02 T32 AI007535 U01 GM076497 U54 GM088558 T32 AI07535",1739,1471-2954,"22398170 Child Child, Preschool Denmark/ep [Epidemiology] Humans Incidence Measles/ep [Epidemiology] *Models, Biological *Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome/ep [Epidemiology] *Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome/et [Etiology] Rotavirus Infections/ep [Epidemiology] Time Factors",Include,"The abstract describes the use of a mathematical model to explore age-incidence patterns for infectious diseases like measles and rotavirus, and applies this understanding to Kawasaki disease to investigate its potential infectious etiology.

107554,94,Modelling the spread of covid-19 in the capital of Brazil using numerical solution and cellular automata,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) still challenges researchers due to its spread and deaths. Hence, the classical epidemic SIR and SEIRD models inspired by the epidemic's outbreak are widely used to predict the evolution of the disease. In addition to classical approaches, describing complex phenomena through Cellular Automata (CA) is a highly effective way to understand the iterations on a populated system. The present research analyzed the usage of CA to generate an epidemic-computational model from a micro perspective based on parameters obtained through a statistical fit from a macro perspective. After validating SIR and SEIRD models with the government official data for Brasilia, Brazil, the authors applied the obtained parameters to the Cellular Automata model. The CA model simulated the spread of the virus from infected to uninfected people in a restrained environment (i.e., a supermarket) under several varied conditions applying an approach never adopted before. The manner of applying CA in this research proved to represent an essential tool in predicting the spread of the coronavirus in confined spaces with random movements of people. The CA numerical open-source presented has the purpose of clarifying how the spread occurs not only as a mathematical curve but in an organic way. The numerical simulations from the CA model allowed the authors to conclude that markets and stores are relevant places where might be infections. Thus, every local store and the market owner should reason about the aspects that could avoid the spread of the disease, coming up with efficient solutions. Each environment has specific features that only those who know them are the ones capable of managing.","Brasilia, Brazil", Journal Article,104353,2021,Oct,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med20&DO=10.1016%2fj.compbiolchem.2021.107554,Computational Biology & Chemistry,152693,Modelling the spread of covid-19 in the capital of Brazil using numerical solution and cellular automata,"Cavalcante, Andre Luis Brasil Borges, Lucas Parreira de Faria Lemos, Moises Antonio da Costa Farias, Marcio Muniz de Carvalho, Hervaldo Sampaio S1476-9271(21)00121-3",,1476-928X,"34352565 *COVID-19/ep [Epidemiology] *Computer Simulation Decision Making Epidemiological Monitoring Humans *Models, Biological Risk Factors *SARS-CoV-2 Supermarkets",Include,"The abstract meets the inclusion criteria as it presents a mathematical model using Cellular Automata (CA) and statistical fitting applied to infectious disease (COVID-19), offers an insight into health systems outcomes regarding spread environments, and involves original peer-reviewed research.",https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2021.107554
,7(8) (no pagination),Multicenter Study of the Risk Factors and Outcomes of Bloodstream Infections Caused by Carbapenem-Non-Susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii in Indonesia,"The prevalence of bacteremia caused by carbapenem-non-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii (CNSAB) continues to increase, and it is associated with a high mortality rate. Early recognition of infection and mortality determinants risk factors is necessary for adequate antibiotic administration. We aimed to determine the risk factors and outcomes of CNSAB bacteremia in Indonesia. A multicenter case-control study was conducted in three referral hospitals in Indonesia. Data were collected retrospectively from January 2019 to December 2021. Cases were defined as patients with bacteremia where CNSAB was isolated from the blood, while the controls were patients with bacteremia caused by carbapenem-susceptible A. baumannii (CSAB). Risk factors for bacteremia and mortality associated with CNSAB bacteremia were determined using univariates analysis (chi-squared and Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney test) and multivariate logistic regression analysis. A total of 144 bacteremia patients were included, of whom 72 patients were for each case and control group. The final model of multivariate regression analysis revealed that bacteremia source from the lower respiratory tract (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.24; 95% CI: 1.58-6.63, p = 0.001) and the use of central venous catheter (aOR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.27-5.18; p = 0.009) were independent risk factors for CNSAB bacteremia. Charlson Comorbidity Index >= 4 (aOR: 28.56; 95% CI: 3.06-265.90, p = 0.003) and Pitt Bacteremia Score >= 4 (aOR: 6.44; 95% CI: 1.17-35.38; p = 0.032) were independent risk factors for mortality due to CNSAB bacteremia. Only high Pitt Bacteremia Score was an independent risk factor for mortality of CSAB bacteremia. In conclusion, we identified the risk factors for CNSAB-associated bacteremia and the risk factors for death, which are relevant for empiric therapy and infection control prevention, as well as prognosis evaluation of patients with bloodstream infections.

,11(7) (no pagination),Multi-View Learning to Unravel the Different Levels Underlying Hepatitis B Vaccine Response,"The immune system acts as an intricate apparatus that is dedicated to mounting a defense and ensures host survival from microbial threats. To engage this faceted immune response and provide protection against infectious diseases, vaccinations are a critical tool to be developed. However, vaccine responses are governed by levels that, when interrogated, separately only explain a fraction of the immune reaction. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a feasibility study to determine if multi-view modeling could aid in gaining actionable insights on response markers shared across populations, capture the immune system's diversity, and disentangle confounders. We thus sought to assess this multi-view modeling capacity on the responsiveness to the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination. Seroconversion to vaccine-induced antibodies against the HBV surface antigen (anti-HBs) in early converters (n = 21; <2 months) and late converters (n = 9; <6 months) and was defined based on the anti-HBs titers (>10IU/L). The multi-view data encompassed bulk RNA-seq, CD4+ T-cell parameters (including T-cell receptor data), flow cytometry data, and clinical metadata (including age and gender). The modeling included testing single-view and multi-view joint dimensionality reductions. Multi-view joint dimensionality reduction outperformed single-view methods in terms of the area under the curve and balanced accuracy, confirming the increase in predictive power to be gained. The interpretation of these findings showed that age, gender, inflammation-related gene sets, and pre-existing vaccine-specific T-cells could be associated with vaccination responsiveness. This multi-view dimensionality reduction approach complements clinical seroconversion and all single modalities. Importantly, this modeling could identify what features could predict HBV vaccine response. This methodology could be extended to other vaccination trials to identify the key features regulating responsiveness.

More than 60% of patients present relapsing and remitting chronic arthralgia with debilitating pain lasting years. There are no specific therapeutic agents to treat and rehabilitee infected persons with CHIK. Persistent pain can lead to incapacitation, requiring long-term pharmacological treatment. Advances in non-pharmacological treatments are necessary to promote pain relief without side effects and to restore functionality. Clinical trials indicate transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can treat a broad range of chronic pain disorders, including diffuse neuromuscular pain and arthralgia. Here, we demonstrate that the tDCS across the primary motor cortex significantly reduces pain in the chronic phase of CHIK. High-resolution computational model was created to analyze the cortical electric field generated during tDCS and a diffuse and clustered brain current flow including M1 ipsilateral and contralateral, left DLPFC, nucleus accumbens, and cingulate was found.

Late referral to higher levels of care may be one of the factors associated with higher mortality. Therefore, we aimed to find simple demographic and laboratory parameters which predict the requirement of admission to a critical care unit. Material(s) and Method(s): A case-control study was undertaken in adult age population >18 years, admitted in a dedicated COVID hospital in South India. A total of 50 patients with severe disease (cases) were compared with 143 mild or asymptomatic cases (controls). Those demographic and laboratory parameters that were found to be significant on univariate analysis were used for multiple logistic regression analysis. Result(s): Univariate analysis of demographic and laboratory data showed higher age, male sex, presence of diabetes mellitus, higher values of C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimer, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and lactate dehydrogenase to be significantly associated with cases. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of these significant variables showed NLR and ferritin to be the independent predictors of the requirement of admission to a critical care unit. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed an NLR value of 5.2 and a ferritin value of 462 microg/L that were able to predict the requirement of admission in critical care units. Conclusion(s): High ferritin and NLR were independent predictors of the requirement of admission in critical care units. NLR is a simple tool that can be used in resource-limited settings for triage and early referral to higher levels of care.

229-49,276,NL MIND-BEST: a web server for ligands and proteins discovery--theoretic-experimental study of proteins of Giardia lamblia and new compounds active against Plasmodium falciparum,"There are many protein ligands and/or drugs described with very different affinity to a large number of target proteins or receptors. In this work, we selected Ligands or Drug-target pairs (DTPs/nDTPs) of drugs with high affinity/non-affinity for different targets.

Unfortunately most QSAR models predict activity against only one protein target and/or have not been implemented in the form of public web server freely accessible online to the scientific community. To solve this problem, we developed here a multi-target QSAR (mt-QSAR) classifier using the MARCH-INSIDE technique to calculate structural parameters of drug and target plus one Artificial Neuronal Network (ANN) to seek the model.

This MLP classifies correctly 611 out of 678 DTPs (sensitivity=90.12%) and 3083 out of 3408 nDTPs (specificity=90.46%), corresponding to training accuracy=90.41%. The validation of the model was carried out by means of external predicting series. The model classifies correctly 310 out of 338 DTPs (sensitivity=91.72%) and 1527 out of 1674 nDTP (specificity=91.22%) in validation series, corresponding to total accuracy=91.30% for validation series (predictability). This model favorably compares with other ANN models developed in this work and Machine Learning classifiers published before to address the same problem in different aspects. We implemented the present model at web portal Bio-AIMS in the form of an online server called: Non-Linear MARCH-INSIDE Nested Drug-Bank Exploration & Screening Tool (NL MIND-BEST), which is located at URL: http://miaja.tic.udc.es/Bio-AIMS/NL-MIND-BEST.php.

5512-5527,38,Nonparametric estimation of the cumulative incidence function under outcome misclassification using external validation data,"Misclassification of outcomes or event types is common in health sciences research and can lead to serious bias when estimating the cumulative incidence functions in settings with competing risks. Recent work has shown how to estimate nonparametric cumulative incidence functions in the presence of nondifferential outcome misclassification when the misclassification probabilities are known. Here, we extend this approach to account for misclassification that is differential with respect to important predictors of the outcome using misclassification probabilities estimated from external validation data. Moreover, we propose a bootstrap approach in which the observations from both the main study data and the external validation study are resampled to allow the uncertainty in the misclassification probabilities to propagate through the analysis into the final confidence intervals, ensuring appropriate confidence interval coverage probabilities. The proposed estimator is shown to be uniformly consistent and simulation studies indicate that both the estimator and the standard error estimation approach perform well in finite samples.

Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to combat this pandemic and control the spread of the virus. In particular, deep learning-based time-series techniques are used to predict worldwide COVID-19 cases for short-term and medium-term dependencies using adaptive learning. This study aimed to predict daily COVID-19 cases and investigate the critical factors that increase the transmission rate of this outbreak by examining different influential factors. Furthermore, the study analyzed the effectiveness of COVID-19 prevention measures. A fully connected deep neural network, long short-term memory (LSTM), and transformer model were used as the AI models for the prediction of new COVID-19 cases. Initially, data preprocessing and feature extraction were performed using COVID-19 datasets from Saudi Arabia. The performance metrics for all models were computed, and the results were subjected to comparative analysis to detect the most reliable model. Additionally, statistical hypothesis analysis and correlation analysis were performed on the COVID-19 datasets by including features such as daily mobility, total cases, people fully vaccinated per hundred, weekly hospital admissions per million, intensive care unit patients, and new deaths per million. The results show that the LSTM algorithm had the highest accuracy of all the algorithms and an error of less than 2%.

Inappropriate empirical therapy was modelled on the basis of patient characteristics, and included in the multivariate model to adjust for confounding. For case-matching analysis, patients with inappropriate empirical therapy (cases) were matched to those with appropriate empirical therapy (controls) on the basis of the propensity score (within 0.03 on a scale of 0-1). In total, 238 patients with SAB were enrolled in the cohort study. Characteristics associated with inappropriate empirical therapy were methicillin resistance, underlying haematological malignancy, no history of colonisation with methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and a long hospital stay before SAB. These variables were included in the propensity score, which had an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 85%.

e23137,6,Predicting hospital-acquired infections by scoring system with simple parameters,"Background

Hospital-acquired infections (HAI) are associated with increased attributable morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospitalization, and economic costs. A simple, reliable prediction model for HAI has great clinical relevance. The objective of this study is to develop a scoring system to predict HAI that was derived from Logistic Regression (LR) and validated by Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) simultaneously.

Methodology/Principal Findings

A total of 476 patients from all the 806 HAI inpatients were included for the study between 2004 and 2005. A sample of 1,376 non-HAI inpatients was randomly drawn from all the admitted patients in the same period of time as the control group. External validation of 2,500 patients was abstracted from another academic teaching center. Sixteen variables were extracted from the Electronic Health Records (EHR) and fed into ANN and LR models. With stepwise selection, the following seven variables were identified by LR models as statistically significant: Foley catheterization, central venous catheterization, arterial line, nasogastric tube, hemodialysis, stress ulcer prophylaxes and systemic glucocorticosteroids. Both ANN and LR models displayed excellent discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.964 versus 0.969, p‚Ää=‚Ää0.507) to identify infection in internal validation. During external validation, high AUC was obtained from both models (AUC: 0.850 versus 0.870, p‚Ää=‚Ää0.447). The scoring system also performed extremely well in the internal (AUC: 0.965) and external (AUC: 0.871) validations.

Conclusions

We developed a scoring system to predict HAI with simple parameters validated with ANN and LR models. Armed with this scoring system, infectious disease specialists can more efficiently identify patients at high risk for HAI during hospitalization. Further, using parameters either by observation of medical devices used or data obtained from EHR also provided good prediction outcome that can be utilized in different clinical settings.",NA, Journal Article,309102,2011,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med8&DO=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0023137,PLoS ONE [Electronic Resource],461915,Predicting hospital-acquired infections by scoring system with simple parameters,"Chang, Ying-Jui Yeh, Min-Li Li, Yu-Chuan Hsu, Chien-Yeh Lin, Chao-Cheng Hsu, Meng-Shiuan Chiu, Wen-Ta",8,1932-6203,"21887234 *Cross Infection/di [Diagnosis] Demography Female Humans Logistic Models Male Middle Aged Neural Networks, Computer Predictive Value of Tests ROC Curve Reproducibility of Results *Research Design",Include,"The abstract describes a study that develops a prediction model for hospital-acquired infections, which is an infectious disease.

,11(no pagination),Prediction of Antimicrobial Resistance in Gram-Negative Bacteria From Whole-Genome Sequencing Data,"Background: Early detection of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens and prescription of more effective antibiotics is a fast-emerging need in clinical practice. High-throughput sequencing technology, such as whole genome sequencing (WGS), may have the capacity to rapidly guide the clinical decision-making process. The prediction of antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria, often the cause of serious systemic infections, is more challenging as genotype-to-phenotype (drug resistance) relationship is more complex than for most Gram-positive organisms. Methods and Findings: We have used NCBI BioSample database to train and cross-validate eight XGBoost-based machine learning models to predict drug resistance to cefepime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, levofloxacin, meropenem, and tobramycin tested in Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella aerogenes, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The input is the WGS data in terms of the coverage of known antibiotic resistance genes by shotgun sequencing reads. Models demonstrate high performance and robustness to class imbalanced datasets. Conclusion(s): Whole genome sequencing enables the prediction of antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria. We present a tool that provides an in silico antibiogram for eight drugs.

e34-e43,3,"Prediction of cervical cancer incidence in England, UK, up to 2040, under four scenarios: a modelling study","Background

In the next 25 years, the epidemiology of cervical cancer in England, UK, will change: human papillomavirus (HPV) screening will be the primary test for cervical cancer. Additionally, the proportion of women screened regularly is decreasing and women who received the HPV vaccine are due to attend screening for the first time. Therefore, we aimed to estimate how vaccination against HPV, changes to the screening test, and falling screening coverage will affect cervical cancer incidence in England up to 2040.
Methods

We did a data modelling study that combined results from population modelling of incidence trends, observable data from the individual level with use of a generalised linear model, and microsimulation of unobservable disease states. We estimated age-specific absolute risks of cervical cancer in the absence of screening (derived from individual level data). We used an age period cohort model to estimate birth cohort effects. We multiplied the absolute risks by the age cohort effects to provide absolute risks of cervical cancer for unscreened women in different birth cohorts. We obtained relative risks (RRs) of cervical cancer by screening history (never screened, regularly screened, or lapsed attender) using data from a population-based case-control study for unvaccinated women, and using a microsimulation model for vaccinated women. RRs of primary HPV screening were relative to cytology. We used the proportion of women in each 5-year age group (25‚Äì29 years to 75‚Äì79 years) and 5-year period (2016‚Äì20 to 2036‚Äì40) who have a combination of screening and vaccination history, and weighted to estimate the population incidence. The primary outcome was the number of cases and rates per 100‚Äà000 women under four scenarios: no changes to current screening coverage or vaccine uptake and HPV primary testing from 2019 (status quo), changing the year in which HPV primary testing is introduced, introduction of the nine-valent vaccine, and changes to cervical screening coverage.
Findings

The status quo scenario estimated that the peak age of cancer diagnosis will shift from the ages of 25‚Äì29 years in 2011‚Äì15 to 55‚Äì59 years in 2036‚Äì40. Unvaccinated women born between 1975 and 1990 were predicted to have a relatively high risk of cervical cancer throughout their lives. Introduction of primary HPV screening from 2019 could reduce age-standardised rates of cervical cancer at ages 25‚Äì64 years by 19%, from 15¬∑1 in 2016 to 12¬∑2 per 100‚Äà000 women as soon as 2028. Vaccination against HPV types 16 and 18 (HPV 16/18) could see cervical cancer rates in women aged 25‚Äì29 years decrease by 55% (from 20¬∑9 in 2011‚Äì15 to 9¬∑5 per 100‚Äà000 women by 2036‚Äì40), and introduction of nine-valent vaccination from 2019 compared with continuing vaccination against HPV 16/18 will reduce rates by a further 36% (from 9¬∑5 to 6¬∑1 per 100‚Äà000 women) by 2036‚Äì40. Women born before 1991 will not benefit directly from vaccination; therefore, despite vaccination and primary HPV screening with current screening coverage, European age-standardised rates of cervical cancer at ages 25‚Äì79 years will decrease by only 10% (from 12¬∑8 in 2011‚Äì15 to 11¬∑5 per 100‚Äà000 women in 2036‚Äì40). If screening coverage fell to 50%, European age-standardised rates could increase by 27% (from 12¬∑8 to 16¬∑3 per 100‚Äà000 by 2036‚Äì40).
Interpretation

Going forward, focus should be placed on scenarios that offer less intensive screening for vaccinated women and more on increasing coverage and incorporation of new technologies to enhance current cervical screening among unvaccinated women.","England, UK", Journal Article,170816,2018,1,"https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med15&DO=10.1016%2fS2468-2667%2817%2930222-0 Landy, Rebecca.

692-7,23,Predictors of the short- and long-term survival of HIV-infected patients admitted to a Brazilian intensive care unit,"The outcomes of HIV-infected patients requiring critical care have improved. However, in developing countries, information about HIV-infected patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) is scarce. We describe the prognosis of HIV-infected patients admitted to a Brazilian ICU and the factors predictive of short- and long-term survival. A historical cohort study, including HIV-infected patients admitted to a Brazilian ICU at an HIV/AIDS reference hospital, was conducted. Survivors were followed up for 24 months after ICU discharge. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data, disease severity scores and mortality were evaluated. Data were analysed using survival and regression models. One hundred and twenty-five patients were studied. In-ICU and in-hospital mortality rates were 46.4% and 68.0%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that the in-ICU mortality was significantly associated with APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II scores (odds ratio [OR], 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.11), mechanical ventilation (OR, 6.39; 95% CI, 1.29-31.76), tuberculosis treatment (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.03-6.71), use of antiretroviral therapy (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05-0.77) and septic shock (OR, 4.38; 95% CI, 1.78-10.76). Septic shock was also associated with long-term survival (hazard ratio, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.31-6.90). In-hospital and in-ICU mortality were higher than those reported for developed countries.

866-81,4,Preventing acute gut wall damage in infectious diarrhoeas with glycosylated dendrimers,"Intestinal pathogens use the host's excessive inflammatory cytokine response, designed to eliminate dangerous bacteria, to disrupt epithelial gut wall integrity and promote their tissue invasion. We sought to develop a non-antibiotic-based approach to prevent this injury. Molecular docking studies suggested that glycosylated dendrimers block the TLR4-MD-2-LPS complex, and a 13.6 kDa polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer glucosamine (DG) reduced the induction of human monocyte interleukin (IL)-6 by Gram-negative bacteria. In a rabbit model of shigellosis, PAMAM-DG prevented epithelial gut wall damage and intestinal villous destruction, reduced local IL-6 and IL-8 expression, and minimized bacterial invasion. Computational modelling studies identified a 3.3 kDa polypropyletherimine (PETIM)-DG as the smallest likely bioactive molecule. In human monocytes, high purity PETIM-DG potently inhibited Shigella Lipid A-induced IL-6 expression. In rabbits, PETIM-DG prevented Shigella-induced epithelial gut wall damage, reduced local IL-6 and IL-8 expression, and minimized bacterial invasion. There was no change in beta-defensin, IL-10, interferon-beta, transforming growth factor-beta, CD3 or FoxP3 expression.

A modeling/simulation approach was undertaken to inform optimal dosing in this population, using previously developed ceftolozane and tazobactam population pharmacokinetic models informed by data from 16 clinical studies. Stochastic simulations were performed using NONMEM to support dose justification. Probability of target attainment (PTA) simulations in plasma and epithelial lining fluid were conducted using a 14-day treatment, with hemodialysis every other weekday for a high-dose (4X), middle-dose (3X), or low-dose (2X) regimen, where X was the recommended dose in patients with complicated intra-abdominal infection/complicated urinary tract infection and ESRD (500 mg/250 mg ceftolozane/tazobactam loading dose and 100 mg/50 mg ceftolozane/tazobactam maintenance dose administered by 1-hour infusion every 8 hours). PTA was determined using established pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic targets: ceftolozane, 30% of the interdose interval (8 hours) in which free ceftolozane concentration exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration value of 4 microg/mL; tazobactam, 20% of the interdose interval in which free tazobactam concentration exceeded 1 microg/mL. Plasma PTA was >90% for both agents for all 3 regimens. Plasma ceftolozane exposures at the high-dose regimen exceeded those from phase 3 study experience. Epithelial lining fluid PTA was >90% for high- and middle-dose regimens but was <80% for tazobactam on dialysis days at the low-dose regimen. For patients with HABP/VABP and ESRD requiring intermittent hemodialysis, the middle-dose regimen of 1.5 g/0.75 g ceftolozane/tazobactam loading + 300 mg/150 mg maintenance every 8 hours by 1-hour infusion is recommended.",NA, Journal Article,70508,2023,"02 Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med23&DO=10.1002%2fjcph.2149 Patel, Yogesh T.

,11(6) (no pagination),"Pseudomonas aeruginosa Community-Onset Bloodstream Infections: Characterization, Diagnostic Predictors, and Predictive Score Development-Results from the PRO-BAC Cohort","Community-onset bloodstream infections (CO-BSI) caused by gram-negative bacilli are common and associated with significant mortality; those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa are associated with worse prognosis and higher rates of inadequateempirical antibiotic treatment. The aims of this study were to describe the characteristics of patients with CO-BSI caused by P. aeruginosa, to identify predictors, and to develop a predictive score for P. aeruginosa CO-BSI. Materials/methods: PROBAC is a prospective cohort including patients >14 years with BSI from 26 Spanish hospitals between October 2016 and May 2017. Patients with monomicrobial P. aeruginosa CO-BSI and mo-nomicrobial Enterobacterales CO-BSI were included. Variables of interest were collected. Independent predictors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa CO-BSI were identified by logistic regression and a predic-tion score was developed. Result(s): A total of 78patients with P. aeruginosa CO-BSI and 2572 with Enterobacterales CO-BSI were included. Patients with P. aeruginosa had a median age of 70 years (IQR 60-79), 68.8% were male, median Charlson score was 5 (IQR 3-7), and 30-daymortality was 18.5%. Multivariate analysis identified the following predictors of CO-BSI-PA [adjusted OR (95% CI)]: male gender [1.89 (1.14-3.12)], haematological malignancy [2.45 (1.20-4.99)], obstructive uropathy [2.86 (1.13-3.02)], source of infection other than urinary tract, biliary tract or intra-abdominal [6.69 (4.10-10.92)] and healthcare-associated BSI [1.85 (1.13-3.02)]. Anindex predictive of CO-BSI-PA was developed; scores >= 3.5 showed a negative predictive value of 89% and an area under the receiver operator curve (ROC) of 0.66. Conclusion(s): We did not find a good predictive score of P. aeruginosa CO-BSI due to its relatively low incidence in the overall population. Our model includes variables that are easy to collect in real clinical practice and could be useful to detect patients with very low risk of P. aeruginosa CO-BSI. Copyright ¬© 2022 by the authors.

e1011317,19,Repeatability and timing of tropical influenza epidemics,"Much of the world experiences influenza in yearly recurring seasons, particularly in temperate areas. These patterns can be considered repeatable if they occur predictably and consistently at the same time of year. In tropical areas, including southeast Asia, timing of influenza epidemics is less consistent, leading to a lack of consensus regarding whether influenza is repeatable. This study aimed to assess repeatability of influenza in Vietnam, with repeatability defined as seasonality that occurs at a consistent time of year with low variation. We developed a mathematical model incorporating parameters to represent periods of increased transmission and then fitted the model to data collected from sentinel hospitals throughout Vietnam as well as four temperate locations. We fitted the model for individual (sub)types of influenza as well as all combined influenza throughout northern, central, and southern Vietnam. Repeatability was evaluated through the variance of the timings of peak transmission. Model fits from Vietnam show high variance (sd = 64-179 days) in peak transmission timing, with peaks occurring at irregular intervals and throughout different times of year. Fits from temperate locations showed regular, annual epidemics in winter months, with low variance in peak timings (sd = 32-57 days). This suggests that influenza patterns are not repeatable or seasonal in Vietnam. Influenza prevention in Vietnam therefore cannot rely on anticipation of regularly occurring outbreaks.",Vietnam, Journal Article,38260,2023,7,"https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med24&DO=10.1371%2fjournal.pcbi.1011317 Thai, Pham Quang.

7327-7337,16,"Risk Factors, Outcomes, and Predictions of Extensively Drug-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii Nosocomial Infections in Patients with Nervous System Diseases","Purpose: Acinetobacter baumannii has evolved to become a major pathogen of nosocomial infections, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors, outcomes, and predictions of extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-A. baumannii nosocomial infections in patients with nervous system diseases (NSDs). Method(s): A retrospective study of patients infected with XDR-A. baumannii admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University (Luzhou, China) from January 2021 to December 2022 was conducted. Three multivariate regression models were used to assess the risk factors and predictive value for specific diagnostic and prognostic subgroups. Result(s): A total of 190 patients were included, of which 84 were diagnosed with NSDs and 80% of those were due to stroke. The overall rates of all-cause mortality for XDR-A. baumannii nosocomial infections and those in NSDs were 38.9% and 40.5%, respectively. Firstly, hypertension, indwelling gastric tube, tracheotomy, deep puncture, bladder irrigation, and pulmonary infections were independent risk factors for XDR-A. baumannii nosocomial infections in patients with NSDs. Moreover, pulmonary infections, the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio, and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were significantly associated with increased mortality rates in patients with nosocomial infections caused by XDR-A. baumannii. Thirdly, NLR and cardiovascular diseases accounted for a high risk of mortality for XDR-A. baumannii nosocomial infections in patients with NSDs. The area under the curves of results from each multivariate regression model were 0.827, 0.811, and 0.853, respectively. Conclusion(s): This study reveals the risk factors of XDR-A. baumannii nosocomial infections in patients with NSDs, and proves their reliable predictive value. Early recognition of patients at high risk, sterilizing medical tools, and regular blood monitoring are all critical aspects for minimizing the nosocomial spread and mortality of A. baumannii infections.

209-13,70,Risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission by anti-HIV-negative blood components in Germany and Austria,"In order to estimate the residual risk of transfusion-transmitted HIV infection we have analyzed the data from two transfusion centers in Austria (Vienna) and Germany (Gottingen) from 1985 to 1994. In Vienna, an incidence of 1:42,000 positive anti-HIV tests in repeat donors and a prevalence of 1:7000 in first-time donors were found in 1993. In Gottingen, the indicence was 1:67,000 and the prevalence 1:7900 from 1985 to 1993. Based on a mathematical model which takes (a) the window period and (b) the false-negative rate of anti-HIV tests, as well as (c) human and operational errors into consideration, we have calculated the residual risk of HIV infection. The residual risk (third generation anti-HIV test) was found to be 1:520,000 (95% confidence interval 1:1340,000-1:210,000), and 1:900,000 (95% confidence interval 1:2340,000-1:380,000) for Vienna and Gottingen, respectively, in 1993. Look-back studies from 1985 till 1994 revealed transfusion-transmitted HIV infections in three recipients (for 1.9 million donations in Vienna) and one recipient (for 160,000 donations in Gottingen) of blood components.

            <jats:p>Of the strategies evaluated, increasing the frequency of syphilis screening to every three months was most effective in reducing reported and incident syphilis infections. Increasing the fraction of individuals tested, without increasing test frequency, resulted a smaller decline in incidence, because reductions in infectious syphilis via treatment were counterbalanced by increased incident syphilis among individuals with prior latent syphilis. For an equivalent number of additional tests performed annually, increased test frequency was consistently more effective than improved coverage.</jats:p>

156-164,26,Serial measurement of type-specific human papillomavirus load enables classification of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia lesions according to occurring human papillomavirus-induced pathway,"This retrospective study examined whether human papillomavirus (HPV) type-specific viral load changes measured in two or three serial cervical smears are predictive for the natural evolution of HPV infections and correlate with histological grades of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), allowing triage of HPV-positive women. A cervical histology database was used to select consecutive women with biopsy-proven CIN in 2012 who had at least two liquid-based cytology samples before the diagnosis of CIN. Before performing cytology, 18 different quantitative PCRs allowed HPV type-specific viral load measurement. Changes in HPV-specific load between measurements were assessed by linear regression, with calculation of coefficient of determination (R) and slope. All infections could be classified into one of five categories: (i) clonal progressing process (R>=0.85; positive slope), (ii) simultaneously occurring clonal progressive and transient infection, (iii) clonal regressing process (R>=0.85; negative slope), (iv) serial transient infection with latency [R<0.85; slopes (two points) between 0.0010 and -0.0010 HPV copies/cell/day], and (v) transient productive infection (R<0.85; slope: +/-0.0099 HPV copies/cell/day). Three hundred and seven women with CIN were included; 124 had single-type infections and 183 had multiple HPV types. Only with three consecutive measurements could a clonal process be identified in all CIN3 cases. We could clearly demonstrate clonal regressing lesions with a persistent linear decrease in viral load (R>=0.85; -0.003 HPV copies/cell/day) in all CIN categories. Type-specific viral load increase/decrease in three consecutive measurements enabled classification of CIN lesions in clonal HPV-driven transformation (progression/regression) and nonclonal virion-productive (serial transient/transient) processes.",NA, Journal Article,207717,2017,3,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med14&DO=10.1097%2fCEJ.0000000000000241,European Journal of Cancer Prevention,330328,Serial measurement of type-specific human papillomavirus load enables classification of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia lesions according to occurring human papillomavirus-induced pathway,"Verhelst, Stefanie Poppe, Willy A J Bogers, Johannes J Depuydt, Christophe E",2,1473-5709,26890987 Humans *Papillomaviridae/cl [Classification] Papillomavirus Infections/bl [Blood] *Papillomavirus Infections/cl [Classification] Papillomavirus Infections/di [Diagnosis] Retrospective Studies *Signal Transduction/ph [Physiology] Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/bl [Blood] *Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/cl [Classification] Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/di [Diagnosis] *Viral Load/cl [Classification] Uterine Cervical Dysplasia/bl [Blood] *Uterine Cervical Dysplasia/cl [Classification] Uterine Cervical Dysplasia/di [Diagnosis],Include,"The study uses linear regression, a statistical model, to assess changes in HPV-specific viral load, fulfilling the mathematical model inclusion criterion.

263-7,37,Serum miR-574-5p: a prognostic predictor of sepsis patients,"Serum micro-RNAs (miRNAs) can be used for the diagnosis and prognosis of various diseases. Using genome-wide scans, we sought to identify serum miRNAs that could be used as prognostic predictors for sepsis patients. We used microarray screens to identify differentially expressed serum miRNAs by comparing samples from 12 surviving and 12 nonsurviving sepsis patients. These differentially expressed serum miRNAs were validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays for 118 sepsis patients. The validated miRNAs along with sepsis patients' clinical indicators were analyzed in a multivariate logistic regression model. Microarray analysis showed that miR-297 and miR-574-5p were differentially expressed in sepsis survivors and nonsurvivors. Upon validation with 118 sepsis patients' samples, these two miRNA expressions were significantly different, with P < 0.001. miR-297 was more closely associated with survival from sepsis, whereas miR-574-5p was associated with death from sepsis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that a combination of sepsis stage, Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment scores, and miR-574-5p was correlated with the death of sepsis patients. The predictive capability of these three combined variables was analyzed by a receiver operating characteristic curve; the area under the curve was 0.932 (95% confidence interval, 0.887-0.977). When the cutoff point was set at 0.288, these three combined variables provided 78.13% sensitivity and 91.84% specificity.

2292-2297,29,Simulation Study of Surveillance Strategies for Faster Detection of Novel SARS-CoV-2 Variants,"Earlier global detection of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants gives governments more time to respond. However, few countries can implement timely national surveillance, resulting in gaps in monitoring. The United Kingdom implemented large-scale community and hospital surveillance, but experience suggests it might be faster to detect new variants through testing England arrivals for surveillance. We developed simulations of emergence and importation of novel variants with a range of infection hospitalization rates to the United Kingdom. We compared time taken to detect the variant though testing arrivals at England borders, hospital admissions, and the general community. We found that sampling 10%-50% of arrivals at England borders could confer a speed advantage of 3.5-6 weeks over existing community surveillance and 1.5-5 weeks (depending on infection hospitalization rates) over hospital testing.

770039,9,Staffing and Capacity Planning for SARS-CoV-2 Monoclonal Antibody Infusion Facilities: A Performance Estimation Calculator Based on Discrete-Event Simulations,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly stressed healthcare systems. The addition of monoclonal antibody (mAb) infusions, which prevent severe disease and reduce hospitalizations, to the repertoire of COVID-19 countermeasures offers the opportunity to reduce system stress but requires strategic planning and use of novel approaches. Our objective was to develop a web-based decision-support tool to help existing and future mAb infusion facilities make better and more informed staffing and capacity decisions.

Materials and Methods: Using real-world observations from three medical centers operating with federal field team support, we developed a discrete-event simulation model and performed simulation experiments to assess performance of mAb infusion sites under different conditions.

Results: 162,000 scenarios were evaluated by simulations. Our analyses revealed that it was more effective to add check-in staff than to add additional nurses for middle-to-large size sites with ‚â•2 infusion nurses; that scheduled appointments performed better than walk-ins when patient load was not high; and that reducing infusion time was particularly impactful when load on resources was only slightly above manageable levels.

Discussion: Physical capacity, check-in staff, and infusion time were as important as nurses for mAb sites. Health systems can effectively operate an infusion center under different conditions to provide mAb therapeutics even with relatively low investments in physical resources and staff.

Conclusion: Simulations of mAb infusion sites were used to create a capacity planning tool to optimize resource utility and allocation in constrained pandemic conditions, and more efficiently treat COVID-19 patients at existing and future mAb infusion sites.",NA, Journal Article,97908,2021,,"https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med20&DO=10.3389%2ffpubh.2021.770039 Thornhill, Jonathan.

21-Sep,118,Strategies for diagnosis and treatment of children at risk for occult bacteremia: clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness,"Decision analysis was used to evaluate the probable health benefits, complications, and costs of six management strategies for febrile children at risk for occult bacteremia. The strategy that combined blood culture with empiric oral antibiotic treatment for all patients was predicted to prevent the highest number of major infections and to have the lowest cost per major infection prevented. The strategy that combined a leukocyte count and blood culture for all patients, followed by empiric antibiotic treatment for those with leukocyte count greater than or equal to 10,000/mm3, had almost equal cost and clinical effectiveness and avoided many antibiotic complications. Culture of blood specimens from all patients and no empiric treatment constituted the third most clinically effective intervention but was the least cost-effective in this model. Giving a 2-day oral course of amoxicillin without testing had the lowest average cost per febrile patient but was the least clinically effective intervention. However, the low degree of effectiveness of empiric treatment alone was based on the assumption that oral amoxicillin therapy was only 20% effective in preventing major infections after bacteremia. At higher estimates of effectiveness, treatment alone became a more viable strategy.

52-7,47,Strategies for immunisation against rubella: evidence from a study in the Kalutara District,"Objective To simulate different immunisation programs against rubella and estimate the proportion of the population susceptible to rubella infection of each.

Methods The impact of 3 immunisation schedules on the susceptibility of women of childbearing age and the community to rubella infection was simulated using a probabilistic approach. The first schedule involved selective immunisation of 12-year old girls, the second immunisation of all children at 3 years of age for different immunisation coverages, and the third comprised a combination of the first two. The proportion of different segments of the population currently susceptible to rubella was obtained from a field study conducted in the Kalutara District in 1999.

Results An immunisation program of 12-year old girls will reduce the susceptibility to rubella in 5 years in only the 15 to 19 year age group. In 10 years, the susceptibility in both the 15 to 19 and 20 to 24 year age groups will be reduced. Immunisation only of children at 3 years will take 20 years for a reduction in the susceptibility to rubella infection in the 15 to 19 year and the 20 to 24 year age groups, and the proportion of the population susceptible to rubella can be reduced to less than 10% in 20 years if 90% coverage is attained. If a combination of the two strategies ie. selective immunisation of girls at 12 years for 10 years and immunisation of all children at 3 years is adopted, the proportion of the community susceptible to rubella will be less than 14% in 10 years.

Conclusions The combination of immunising girls at 12 years of age for 10 years and all children at 3 years of age against rubella is recommended for Sri Lanka to reduce the risk of congenital rubella syndrome in the short term and the proportion susceptible to rubella in the community in the long term.",Kalutara District; Sri Lanka, Journal Article,410527,2002,Jun,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med4&DO=10.4038%2fcmj.v47i2.3453,Ceylon Medical Journal,538271,Strategies for immunisation against rubella: evidence from a study in the Kalutara District,"Palihawadana, P Wickremasinghe, A R Perera, J",2,0009-0875,"12140879 Child Child, Preschool Disease Susceptibility Female Humans Male Models, Theoretical Pregnancy Rubella/im [Immunology] *Rubella/pc [Prevention & Control] *Rubella Vaccine/ad [Administration & Dosage] Sri Lanka *Vaccination 0 (Rubella Vaccine)",Include,"The abstract pertains to a simulation study, which indicates the use of a mathematical model to evaluate different immunisation strategies against rubella, an infectious disease.

We modified Pinkerton's model, which was an adaptation of Kaplan's simplified needle circulation theory model, to compare different syringe supply levels, account for syringes from non-NSP sources, and reflect reduction in syringe sharing and contamination. With an annual $10 to $50 million funding increase, 194-816 HIV infections would be averted (cost per infection averted $51,601-$61,302).

,12(4) (no pagination),The Impact of Asymptomatic Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Positive Disease Status on Inpatient Complications Following Spine Surgery: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis,"In the United States, nearly 1.2 million people > 12 years old have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is associated with postoperative complications following orthopedic procedures. Little is known about how asymptomatic HIV (AHIV) patients fare postoperatively. This study compares complications after common spine surgeries between patients with and without AHIV. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) was retrospectively reviewed from 2005-2013, identifying patients aged > 18 years who underwent 2-3-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), >=4-level thoracolumbar fusion (TLF), or 2-3-level lumbar fusion (LF). Patients with AHIV and without HIV were 1:1 propensity score-matched. Univariate analysis and multivariable binary logistic regression were performed to assess associations between HIV status and outcomes by cohort. 2-3-level ACDF (n = 594 total patients) and >=4-level TLF (n = 86 total patients) cohorts demonstrated comparable length of stay (LOS), rates of wound-related, implant-related, medical, surgical, and overall complications between AHIV and controls. 2-3-level LF (n = 570 total patients) cohorts had comparable LOS, implant-related, medical, surgical, and overall complications. AHIV patients experienced higher postoperative respiratory complications (4.3% vs. 0.4%,). AHIV was not associated with higher risks of medical, surgical, or overall inpatient postoperative complications following most spine surgical procedures. The results suggest the postoperative course may be improved in patients with baseline control of HIV infection.

302-20,80,The impact of needle-exchange programs on the spread of HIV among injection drug users: a simulation study,"Objective. To determine the impact of the implementation of a needle-exchange program (NEP) on the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in an injection drug user (IDU) community. We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study of a theoretical population of 10,000 IDUs. The population was followed monthly from 1984 to 2000. HIV was assumed to be transmitted only by needle sharing. The NEP was introduced in 1989 and evaluated over a period of 11 years. The impacts of the proportion of the population attending the NEP, the risk level of IDUs attending the NEP, the reduction in needle-sharing frequency, and the number of new needle-sharing partners acquired at the NEP on prevalence and incidence of HIV were determined. Increasing the proportion of the population who always attend the NEP and eliminating needle-sharing incidents among IDUs who always attended the NEP were the most effective ways of reducing the spread of HIV. Attracting high-risk users instead of lower risk users to the NEP also reduced the spread of HIV, but to a lesser extent. NEPs are effective at reducing the spread of HIV; even under the worst case scenario of low risk users more likely to attend the NEP, one additional partner per month as a result of attending the NEP, and poor NEP attendance, the estimated prevalence was still less than that from the scenario without an NEP.

Lymphatic filariasis is a disease with a complex natural history with many unknowns. This complicates decision making with respect to control strategies. With LYMFASIM, a variety of hypotheses can be tested about the life history of the parasite Wuchereria bancrofti, its transmission from man to man through mosquitoes, the role of the immune system in regulating parasite numbers, the development of disease symptoms, and the effects of control measures (drug treatment or mosquito control). The implications of alternative assumptions and uncertainty about the quantification of parameters for the effectiveness of control strategies can be investigated.

The present retrospective, longitudinal study (clinicaltrial.gov NCT02044588) using propensity score matching technique was conducted to compare outcomes of KT between HBsAg(-) recipients with anti-HBs titer above 100 mIU/mL undergoing KT from HBsAg(+) donors (n = 43) and HBsAg(-) donors (n = 86). During the median follow-up duration of 58.2 months (range 16.7-158.3 months), there were no significant differences in graft and patient survivals. No HBV-infective markers, including HBsAg, hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis B extracellular antigen and HBV DNA quantitative test were detected in HBsAg(+) donor group. Renal pathology outcomes revealed comparable incidences of kidney allograft rejection while there were no incidences of HBV-associated glomerulonephritis and viral antigen staining. Recipients undergoing KT from HBsAg(+) donors with no HBV prophylaxis (n = 20) provided comparable outcomes with those treated with lamivudine alone (n = 21) or lamivudine in combination with HBV immunoglobulin (n = 2).

264-275,8,The unequal effects of the health-economy trade-off during the COVID-19 pandemic,"Despite the global impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the question of whether mandated interventions have similar economic and public health effects as spontaneous behavioural change remains unresolved. Addressing this question, and understanding differential effects across socioeconomic groups, requires building quantitative and fine-grained mechanistic models. Here we introduce a data-driven, granular, agent-based model that simulates epidemic and economic outcomes across industries, occupations and income levels. We validate the model by reproducing key outcomes of the first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 in the New York metropolitan area. The key mechanism coupling the epidemic and economic modules is the reduction in consumption due to fear of infection. In counterfactual experiments, we show that a similar trade-off between epidemic and economic outcomes exists both when individuals change their behaviour due to fear of infection and when non-pharmaceutical interventions are imposed. Low-income workers, who perform in-person occupations in customer-facing industries, face the strongest trade-off.",New York metropolitan area, Journal Article,17312,2024,Feb,"https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med25&DO=10.1038%2fs41562-023-01747-x Aleta, Alberto.

We selected SARD-related deaths using National Open Data and Information from the Ministry of Health, Mexico, and ICD-10 codes. We assessed the observed compared to the predicted mortality values for 2020 and 2021, employing trends from 2010 to 2019 with joinpoint and prediction modelling analyses. Among 12,742 deaths due to SARD between 2010 and 2021, the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) increased significantly between 2010 and 2019 (pre-pandemic) (annual percentage change [APC] 1.1%; 95% CI 0.2-2.1), followed by a non-significant decrease during the pandemic period (APC 13.9%; 95% CI 13.9-5.3). In addition, the observed ASMR of 1.19 for 2020 for SARD and of 1.14 for 2021 were lower than the predicted values of 1.25 (95% CI 1.22-1.28) for 2020 and 1.25 (95% CI 1.20-1.30) for 2021. Similar findings were identified for specific SARD, mainly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or by sex or age group.

1127-37,145,Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive rate. Tuberculosis as an example,"The basic reproductive rate (R0) is a measure of the severity of an epidemic. On the basis of replicated Latin hypercube sampling, the authors performed an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive rate of tuberculosis (TB). The uncertainty analysis allowed for the derivation of a frequency distribution for R0 and the assessment of the relative contribution each of the three components of R0 made when TB epidemics first arose centuries ago. (The three components of R0 are associated with fast, slow, and relapse TB.) R0 estimates indicated the existence of fairly severe epidemics when TB epidemics first arose. The R0 for the susceptible persons who developed TB slowly (R0(slow)) contributed the most to the R0 estimates; however, the relative R0(slow) contribution decreased as the severity of TB epidemics increased. The sensitivity of the magnitude of R0 to the uncertainty in estimating values of each of the input parameters was assessed. These results indicated that five of the nine input parameters, because of their estimation uncertainty, were influential in determining the magnitude of R0. This uncertainty and sensitivity methodology provides results that can aid investigators in understanding the historical epidemiology of TB by quantifying the effect of the transmission processes involved. Additionally, this method can be applied to the R0 of any other infectious disease to estimate the probability of an epidemic outbreak.",NA, Journal Article,440176,1997,"Jun 15 Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med4&DO=10.1093%2foxfordjournals.aje.a009076,American Journal of Epidemiology,320722,Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive rate.

Early identification of the pathogen and its antibiotic resistance profile is crucial for a favorable outcome. Given the fact that more than 24 hours are usually required to perform common antibiotic resistance tests after the sample collection, the implementation of machine learning methods could be of significant help in selecting empirical antibiotic treatment based only on the sample type, Gram stain, and patient's basic characteristics.

1711-6,155,Validity of a decision tree for predicting active pulmonary tuberculosis,"The recent outbreaks of multidrug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis in health care facilities has increased concern over its transmission in health care facilities. Isolation has been recommended for all patients suspected to have tuberculosis even though the feasibility and the cost of this recommendation can be substantial. We have developed a classification tree using clinical and radiographic data from 277 isolation episodes in patients admitted between August 1992 and March 1994 who required isolation for suspicion of tuberculosis. The classification tree was developed with a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100% by binary recursive partitioning to predict those patients who are unlikely to require isolation. The predictor variables were upper zone disease on chest radiograph, a history of fever, weight loss, and CD4 count. The tree was validated in a separate cohort of 286 isolation episodes between April 1994 and December 1995. In this validation cohort, no erroneous prediction was made of not isolating a patient with active pulmonary tuberculosis. The classification tree had a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 92.5 to 100%), a specificity of 48.1% (95% CI: 43.8 to 52.4%), and a negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI: 98.5 to 100%).

117748,243,Global prediction for mpox epidemic,"The mpox epidemic had spread worldwide and become an epidemic of international concern. Before the emergence of targeted vaccines and specific drugs, it is necessary to numerically simulate and predict the epidemic. In order to better understand and grasp its transmission situation, and take some countermeasures accordingly when necessary, we predicted and simulated mpox transmission, vaccination and control scenarios using model developed for COVID-19 predictions. The results show that the prediction model can also achieve good results in predicting the mpox epidemic based on modified SEIR model.

1952-1961,74,Minocycline treatment for pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex disease based on pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and Bayesian framework mathematical models,"Objectives
Our aim was to identify the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters of minocycline in the hollow-fibre system (HFS) model of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and to identify the optimal clinical dose.
Methods
Minocycline MICs for 55 MAC clinical isolates from the Netherlands were determined. We also co-incubated primary isolated macrophages infected with MAC with minocycline. Next, we performed a 28‚Äâday HFS-MAC model dose‚Äìresponse study in which we mimicked pulmonary concentration‚Äìtime profiles achieved in patients. The HFS-MAC model was sampled at intervals to determine the minocycline pharmacokinetics and MAC burden. We identified the AUC0‚Äì24/MIC ratios associated with 1.0 log10 cfu/mL kill below day 0 (stasis), defined as a bactericidal effect. We then performed 10000 Monte Carlo experiments to identify the optimal dose for a bactericidal effect in patients.
Results
The MIC for 50% and 90% of cumulative clinical isolates was 8 and 64‚Äâmg/L, respectively. Minocycline decreased MAC bacterial burden below stasis in primary isolated macrophages. In the HFS-MAC model, minocycline achieved a microbial kill of 3.6 log10 cfu/mL below stasis. The AUC0‚Äì24/MIC exposure associated with a bactericidal effect was 59. Monte Carlo experiments identified a minocycline susceptibility MIC breakpoint of 16‚Äâmg/L. At this proposed breakpoint, the clinical dose of 200‚Äâmg/day achieved the bactericidal effect exposure target in ‚àº50% of patients, while 400‚Äâmg/day achieved this in 73.6% of patients, in Monte Carlo experiments.
Conclusions
Minocycline at a dose of 400‚Äâmg/day is expected to be bactericidal.

The emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of S. flexneri is a growing public health threat worldwide, while large-scale studies monitoring the longitudinal AMR trends of isolates remain scarce. Here, the AMR gene (ARG) profiles of 717 S. flexneri isolates from 1920 to 2020 worldwide were determined. The results showed that the average number of ARGs in isolates has increased significantly, from 19.2 +/- 2.4 before 1970 to 29.6 +/- 5.3 after 2010. In addition, mobile genetic elements were important contributors to ARGs in S. flexneri isolates. The results of the structural equation model showed that the human development index drove the consumption of antibiotics and indirectly promoted the antibiotic resistance. Finally, a machine learning algorithm was used to predict the antibiotic resistance risk of global terrestrial S. flexneri isolates and successfully map the antibiotic resistance threats in global land habitats with over 80% accuracy.

<jats:sec id=""sec003"">
<jats:title>Findings</jats:title>
<jats:p>The simulations are fitted using the pandemic data from 148 countries from January 2020 to June 2021. Under the baseline scenario, the world will add 24.36 million cases and 468,945 deaths during the projection period of three months. Inoculating at least 10%, 20%, and 26% of populations in all countries requires 1.12, 3.31, and 5.00 million additional vaccine doses every day, respectively. Achieving these benchmarks reduces new cases by 0.56, 2.74, and 3.32 million, respectively. If allocated by the current global distribution, 5.00 million additional vaccine doses will only avert 1.45 million new cases. If those 5.00 million vaccines are allocated based on projected cases in each country, the averted cases will increase more than six-fold to 9.20 million.

1817-27,30,Predicting virological decay in patients starting combination antiretroviral therapy,"Objective: 
Model trajectories of viral load measurements from time of starting combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), and use the model to predict whether patients will achieve suppressed viral load (‚â§200 copies/ml) within 6-months of starting cART.

Design: 
Prospective cohort study including HIV-positive adults (UK Collaborative HIV Cohort Study).

Methods: 
Eligible patients were antiretroviral naive and started cART after 1997. Random effects models were used to estimate viral load trends. Patients were randomly selected to form a validation dataset with those remaining used to fit the model. We evaluated predictions of suppression using indices of diagnostic test performance.

Results: 
Of 9562 eligible patients 6435 were used to fit the model and 3127 for validation. Mean log10 viral load trajectories declined rapidly during the first 2 weeks post-cART, moderately between 2 weeks and 3 months, and more slowly thereafter. Higher pretreatment viral load predicted steeper declines, whereas older age, white ethnicity, and boosted protease inhibitor/non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors based cART-regimen predicted a steeper decline from 3 months onwards. Specificity of predictions and the diagnostic odds ratio substantially improved when predictions were based on viral load measurements up to the 4-month visit compared with the 2 or 3-month visits. Diagnostic performance improved when suppression was defined by two consecutive suppressed viral loads compared with one.

357-363,55,Predictive value of multiple variable models including nutritional risk score (NRS 2002) on mortality and length of stay of patients with covid-19 infections. The INCOVO study,"Background and aims

This study aimed at evaluating associations between nutritional status and outcomes in patients with Covid-19 and to identify statistical models including nutritional parameters associated with in-hospital mortality and length of stay.
Methods

Data of 5707 adult patients hospitalized in the University Hospital of Lausanne between March 2020 and March 2021 were screened retrospectively 920 patients (35% female) with confirmed Covid-19 and complete data including nutritional risk score (NRS 2002), were included. This cohort was divided into three subgroups: NRS <3: no risk of malnutrition; NRS ‚â•3 to <5: moderate risk malnutrition; and NRS ‚â•5: severe risk of malnutrition. The primary outcome was the percentage of in-hospital deaths in the different NRS subgroups. The secondary outcomes were the length of hospital stay (LOS), the percentage of admissions to intensive care units (ICU), and the length of stay in the ICU (ILOS). Logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality and hospital stay. Multivariate clinical-biological models were developed to study predictions of mortality and very long length of stay.
Results

The mean age of the cohort was 69.7 years. The death rate was 4 times higher in the subgroup with a NRS ‚â• 5 (44%), and 3 times higher with a NRS ‚â• 3 to <5 (33%) compared to the patients with a NRS<3 (10%) (p < 0.001). LOS was significantly higher in the NRS ‚â• 5 and NRS ‚â• 3 to <5 subgroups (26.0 days; CI [21; 30.9]; and 24.9; CI [22.5; 27.1] respectively) versus 13.4; CI [12; 14.8] for NRS<3 (p < 0.001). The mean ILOS was significantly higher in the NRS ‚â• 5 (5.9 days; versus 2.8 for NRS ‚â• 3 to <5, and 1.58 for NRS<3 (p < 0.001)). In logistic regression, NRS ‚â• 3 was significantly associated with the risk of mortality (OR: 4.8; CI [3.3; 7.1]; p < 0.001) and very long in-hospital stay (>12 days) (OR: 2.5; CI [1.9; 3.3]; p < 0.001). Statistical models that included a NRS ‚â• 3 and albumin revealed to be strong predictors for mortality and LOS (area under the curve 0.800 and 0.715).
Conclusion

NRS was found to be an independent risk factor for in-hospital death and LOS in hospitalized Covid-19 patients. Patients with a NRS ‚â• 5 had a significant increase in ILOS and mortality.

The highest population-level impact occurred when LAI-PrEP uptake and persistence improved.</jats:p>

e69654,8,The potential impact of improving appropriate treatment for fever on malaria and non-malarial febrile illness management in under-5s: a decision-tree modelling approach,"Background

As international funding for malaria programmes plateaus, limited resources must be rationally managed for malaria and non-malarial febrile illnesses (NMFI). Given widespread unnecessary treatment of NMFI with first-line antimalarial Artemisinin Combination Therapies (ACTs), our aim was to estimate the effect of health-systems factors on rates of appropriate treatment for fever and on use of ACTs.

Methods

A decision-tree tool was developed to investigate the impact of improving aspects of the fever care-pathway and also evaluate the impact in Tanzania of the revised WHO malaria guidelines advocating diagnostic-led management

Results

Model outputs using baseline parameters suggest 49% malaria cases attending a clinic would receive ACTs (95% Uncertainty Interval:40.6‚Äì59.2%) but that 44% (95% UI:35‚Äì54.8%) NMFI cases would also receive ACTs. Provision of 100% ACT stock predicted a 28.9% increase in malaria cases treated with ACT, but also an increase in overtreatment of NMFI, with 70% NMFI cases (95% UI:56.4‚Äì79.2%) projected to receive ACTs, and thus an overall 13% reduction (95% UI:5‚Äì21.6%) in correct management of febrile cases. Modelling increased availability or use of diagnostics had little effect on malaria management outputs, but may significantly reduce NMFI overtreatment. The model predicts the early rollout of revised WHO guidelines in Tanzania may have led to a 35% decrease (95% UI:31.2‚Äì39.8%) in NMFI overtreatment, but also a 19.5% reduction (95% UI:11‚Äì27.2%), in malaria cases receiving ACTs, due to a potential fourfold decrease in cases that were untested or tested false-negative (42.5% vs.8.9%) and so untreated.

Discussion

Modelling multi-pronged intervention strategies proved most effective to improve malaria treatment without increasing NMFI overtreatment. As malaria transmission declines, health system interventions must be guided by whether the management priority is an increase in malaria cases receiving ACTs (reducing the treatment gap), reducing ACT waste through unnecessary treatment of NMFI or expanding appropriate treatment of all febrile illness.",Tanzania, Journal Article,271820,2013,,https://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&CSC=Y&NEWS=N&PAGE=fulltext&D=med10&DO=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0069654,PLoS ONE [Electronic Resource],464377,The potential impact of improving appropriate treatment for fever on malaria and non-malarial febrile illness management in under-5s: a decision-tree modelling approach,"Rao, V Bhargavi Schellenberg, David Ghani, Azra C G0600719 MR/K010174/1",7,1932-6203,23922770 *Decision Support Techniques *Decision Trees *Fever/dt [Drug Therapy] Humans *Malaria/dt [Drug Therapy] 0 (Antimalarials),Include,"The study uses a decision-tree modelling approach, which qualifies as a mathematical model focusing on health systems outcomes related to infectious diseases (malaria and febrile illnesses in this case).

                <jats:p>Residents of British Columbia, Canada, aged‚Äâ‚â•‚Äâ16¬†years, were recruited via online advertisements between February and March 2022, and provided information about vaccination status, perceived vaccination status of household and non-household contacts, compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines, and history of COVID-19. A deterministic mathematical model was used to assess transmission dynamics between vaccine status groups under conditions of high and low vaccine efficacy.</jats:p>

                <jats:p>Vaccine homophily was observed among those with 0, 2, or 3 doses of the vaccine. Greater homophily was observed among those who had more doses of the vaccine (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.0001). Those with fewer vaccine doses had larger contact networks (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.0001), were more likely to report prior COVID-19 (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.0001), and reported lower compliance with COVID-19 prevention guidelines (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‚Äâ&lt;‚Äâ0.0001). Mathematical modelling showed that vaccine homophily plays a considerable role in epidemic growth under conditions of high and low vaccine efficacy. Furthermore, vaccine homophily contributes to a high force of infection among unvaccinated individuals under conditions of high vaccine efficacy, as well as to an elevated force of infection from unvaccinated to suboptimally vaccinated individuals under conditions of low vaccine efficacy.</jats:p>
